# The Question is: What information can be mined from a verbal journal.
Is it possible to mine a bunch of unstructured text data to solve your issues. 
Mine is to 10x my productivity and ability to create applications and tools as well as organize my life.

I believe for this that AI workflows should mimic human workflows. I am beginning to see that everything can be understood as existing in a population of 
data of the same type. There are distributions that exist on this universe of ojects and learning those distributions allows us to generate synthetic versions of them. This is my way of understanding what I hear called generative AI. Now I think the benefit a human can provide is by describing a what the object to be generated is well. A mathematical or computational way needs to be given. an abstraction of sorts.

The first practical thing I want to make is a "report" for Dr. Spight to see tomorrow. I want to be able to click generate report
and it gives me notes I can present with specific reference to which thought relates to what. I am making an internal knowledge base.
I really want to embed my journal in a vector space.

# What data structure is my journal? What object is it in a categorical sense?

# Categorical understandings of AI? -- look into it.

Think of a LLM more like a transistor or neuron that has a super diverse output but you want to organize them into a bunch of more stuff.

Calculate how many LLMS can glue together.
