 In order to achieve this goal of generating good problems, I think it would be beneficial to understand the anatomy of what makes a good problem. I think first we should look to science on what defines a good research question. From what I remember you want it to be falsifiable, meaning that it's not open-ended enough to where no answer exists or there's no way to do experiment with it or things like that. It should be falsifiable. It should not have a moving target. A really good question is something that you can do experiments to interact with. You can theorize and it combines into existing knowledge in a consistent way. A good question is also very well defined. It's usually can be turned into just specifying one true false thing that if a true false thing happens we can be reasonably believing it a really good question. It doesn't really care about biases or who you are. A really good question is just something that you either it's either true or it's not and you have a path towards working towards that and it requires good problem solving, it requires ingenuity and it requires if you understand that question something really important will be learnt basically.

 I took a little nap and thought of different ideas. One of them was a quest log, you know, like Skyrim, the video game, and I returned the journey to a actual quest log. You know, maybe that would give me more direction. Then I thought of a bunch of different spin-off apps, one of them being to solve this problem about how I'm using all this AI to generate apps, but I can't really explain the apps myself so I'd kind of feed it. All the files in a folder and turn that to like a lesson plan or something. Yeah, so basically it turned my own project into a lesson plan that I have to learn. And I understand the answer to my project. Hey, related to this, I was wondering if there's a way to like, you know, you take all the files and they tell you which ones I connected to watch and related to what that would be useful. Get like a graph. I mean, I want to make so many different things, but I just like a web app where people actually use it. That would be a pretty great thing. Yeah, I think I did my job on this one.

 So I just lost my recording that I was supposed to have. This is the annoying part. I shouldn't... Please stop that from happening. Like if I haven't uploaded it yet, ask me if I didn't upload it yet. But anyway, I was saying, I was making all of these different things that seemed like job postings. And it's kind of similar to the job market because there is jobs that seem to pay well, but I don't want that job. And so I thought, why not simulate a mini job market so that Chatchy BT knows which jobs it should recommend me. So I need to be able to give feedback. So I need to prompt for all these jobs. And then I need to go through and thumbs up or thumbs down them, save that data, give it back to Chatchy BT. So it knows what I like and don't like.

 Quick update. My mind is buzzing. And I'm already using this app to document my ideas. I'm going to definitely have a shitty time. Doing the data management, but a shitty time means I did time because this is valuable data, which I don't want to delete and I want to store. So I'm going to treat it nicely. I really don't know what I should do next, which means I should probably build the tool that tells me what to do next. So hopefully I would have done that by the end of the day, but I'm going to take a break. Yeah, the app journal guy out.

 Yeah, so I think when I'm I'm it's it's with any time I'm not using this product and everything about a product that is for me is you have to be me to use this well but then also don't forget it's interesting to find there people who you know how we meet people and go that's exactly how my brain was but that's the thing I would be surprised how suddenly it's like yeah that's it you know how I've been doing all of this talking about you know how do I how do I not think about money this type of thing makes you not think about money at all because I'm what you're gonna pay yourself I'm trying to make my journal but the thing is the reason I'm making this is to make my life better one and that I was on the couch reason I was talking to myself is I was thinking okay again is a journal really to make me more productive is it that's never why I had a journal the reason why I had a journal was just it became a nice place to think out loud and like you said then you can know what's going on in some and those ideas you can use later yes a lot of what I've been doing and also to I find when I when I journal I almost like begin excavating things which are in there that I didn't realize I'm in there so that's one way of because I keep on thinking well if I'm so creative in many ways not against something pops up and I'm like oh wow that's an amazing thought I'm convinced there's more in there so general becomes a way to to find those things yeah isn't I'm making me realize is it to do I need to yeah keep thinking about that way of identifying speakers at least they don't have to be a unique idea but just distinguish people on the the room because I'm thinking what my whole thinking about journals is you don't know what's useful one thing I did that has been useful to me is every time I do a coding project I didn't use to save them I'll just do the coding solve the problem and get a new computer lose all the code and then I'll never use the code because I never the problem again but I started putting my code on call think called GitHub which means it's a place to save your code and do all this different stuff and a lot of the project that I'm doing now I've gone back and used my other stuff that I've done before like a year ago two years ago to help me on this and to me that's the point of recording stuff because you don't know what might be useful later because you know suppose I'm having a conversation with someone and they start telling me an idea and I'm like wait I think I've had this idea before let me go yeah look on you know or the another thing is one day I want to write a book it would be the easiest way to write a book yeah I'm gonna have imagine I use this for every day for the next year this is my 2025 journal I'm gonna be there talking to my data and then I have another problem be like hmm sometimes I might not be at home so I need a way to talk to my journal when I'm away boom but I let's say how many characters did I generate or words that generate in that speech let's say let's do a calculation okay one minute if I talk pretty slowly that's like one word per second I think I talked way more than one word per second let's say a hundred words per minute so I talked with 10 words this a thousand words so I think I'd probably talk to my thing for like an hour a day I call it 10,000 words 10,000 words 10,000 words let's say to every day for a month that's 300,000 words I'm saying the point is editing for a million words you want to edit and get a hundred right that's what a really good book is but the thing that I was hated with writing in school was I would do the entire thing all at once I would sit there try and generate a million words choose the one that I thought was worthwhile and then write on the page think for another 10 minutes right the next way and I'd be there for like 10 hours and I have two paragraphs I was supposed to have three four pages but the editing process is supposed to be vomit cut vomit cut vomit cut vomit cut and it's so easy for me to vomit out but for other people like Melissa can't do that but I'm like I already have this ability to just like how am I able to just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk so the only problem is I can talk talk talk talk talk but I can't write right right right right I would hear about great writers what could great writers do right yeah all day long well great readers look the great readers do read I can't read I can't write and I can't read and you expect me to use a journal hell no so to me what I'm really making is for people who grew up in an oral tradition or a context where conversation was the main medium how they exchanged knowledge and do ideas I want a journal for that place I don't want a journal for the written language place yeah you know there's this guy from Michigan who gave her dad on your grandpa a laptop my dad and he was Gary and Gary got worked so hard to make sure that this laptop the microphone was dad's voice could could really decipher dad's voice and so supposed to be writing his book and to speak and it turned out that these ones in had not calculated into that factor your grandpa requires an audience like you know you were saying you could lie there on the couch and just talk talk but your grandpa could not do that he had to have an audience it couldn't just like sit there and talk I think to me the audience helps me in focusing what I'm saying because when I talk to myself I'll go down a tangent yeah when I talk to someone else it's nice to know did that make sense no okay let me explain did that make sense no okay I mean I know that I don't care about this being a product because I was really thinking about no okay petition that everything in life so annoying but what is it that really brings me joy in life to be able to go to bed one of the things is to be able to go to bed and say you know I progressed on something I played the piano a little bit I wasn't that good but I played which means tomorrow be better because progress is really in the baby steps and yeah you'll have days where you suddenly realize how far you've come but it's really a slog everything is a slog everything is but you really have to be doing and that's the reason I got this piano because I realized I can think all I want about putting piano but if I spend 10 minutes 30 minutes a day playing around in a month I'll be way better than I ever was in my whole life my whole life and the reason okay the gym I should be going to the reason I'm not going to gym is because there's so many I think I was at a place at the gym where I feel like I could get back wherever I wherever I was at I could get back in a month or two it's like the gym I didn't really have any goal that I feel like I needed to I was losing out on you know because my main thing is I just need to not lose weight don't need to go to the gym to let lose weight no I just need to make sure I eat to me is harder and then the gym helps because you get hungry but still do you think I want I want you to talk with you because you are going to help me generate more text now let me see if this works

 I told him about how I want to own my own data. And I think he began to see, and what I'm saying, the thing I wanted to communicate to him was, it's not about making a company. And it's obviously my fault for using triggering words that I know people have history with. But it was a good reminder to me that it's not about starting a company. It might literally be an out, but I think starting a company means to me. But what it means to someone, as well as it's about, it's not about making a lot of money. That's not my passion, believe it or not. It's not about managing people on any power or influence. I don't really care about that. What it is to me, and the thing about Frank is, as the more I push, I'm saying, no, I'm serious about this. The more I feel like he was like, well, not about the money, but he needed to pay the bills. And then I began to hear Frank, everything holding Frank back from doing something. And when I talked to Daniel, who was like 28, he called me out there, and he said he signed this contract and he's going to get $10,000 in an experimental funding. And that stuff finally seemed like money's going to come in. And he told me, I've done it all just by being more like you, and being more like, no, it's just being myself and trying to be more people, love me. And I mean, this stupid situation, what the thing I want to focus on, the very specific problem thing with Frank was, viewing myself as a 23-year-old person who can barely figure out how to graduate college, doesn't have a job, seems to totally struggle and feeling like I'm existing in the world, and the world is saying doing a good job, because I feel like I don't get rewarded from systems. I get rewarded from people, but institutions, I seem to break them. I seem to not, I was a neighbor, I seem to not know how to do it. I seem to not know how to play by the rules. And for that reason, when I meet people who are older than me, even if by year or two I assume, you know how to be a human better than I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what was happening is with Daniel, stuff I didn't realize that, let's say, I do go and make such a company or something work. Like I'm saying, the people who know me know that the concern isn't, are you going to do it? Or can you do it? Then it might seriously be the case that Crank will be like, how the hell did you do that? I've tried to do that 10 times, and it never worked in fact. But at some point in my life, and I don't know, I don't see cultured this way, because I'm sure a lot of people said, I want to go to this really fancy place, and they didn't. For me, everything is, here's a goal. How do you get there? It's not, this is impossible. Yeah, yeah. I tried this and I get, if I try to learn this piano, I've tried to learn something like piano so many times. And you know what I think? No, I finally get why I wasn't learning it well, and it was because I thought I needed to learn how to play scale and stuff. No, I just need to find a way to touch the keys every day. So I was doing that, and Donkey, I was wanting to down. I went and I figured out that my point is...

 I think Wordal was a very interesting website because it was not an app, it was a website and it took everyone by storm and it seamlessly integrated into everyone's workflow because it was so obvious as soon as you went to the website you knew exactly what you should do and it didn't change and it was the same every day and you could put in your routine. I wish there was something like that where I'd post my ideas and people can live, interact with them and give feedback as they read. I think it's not good if they give feedback only when they finish. There needs to be live feedback option for people that want to do that or if you just want to read the whole thing I should also give you that option but I think live feedback would be good for a lot of audiences. So I need to somehow get live analytics and I want to even make it so it is a brain teaser so you get a reward for listening to me because I don't want to just assume that it's worth listening to me. I want to reward people for listening to me.

 So just an update me and GPT have been going back and forth on... well it's really just been doing what I tell it to do but I've added topic extraction with some custom topics that I got by giving all of the text so far to GPT and asking for a custom topic list. I don't know how good it is but we'll see. There's also keyword extraction. I think right now I'm doing all the keyword and all that stuff on command but it would be nice if I pre-computed that beforehand and I can do that maybe later. I updated the styling so it looks a little bit nicer and I think there's more to do with that later. Just something to note. For a recorded audio playback it doesn't actually work on mobile for some reason. Not that that's a really important feature but it's a feature that's there and doesn't work. I mean yeah at some point it's going to be actual data analysis on the text but the user experience is pretty great right now.

 My mind is buzzing with ideas. I just watched a cool video by a pretty small YouTuber about what's called the personal web. And it raised an interesting point to me, which is that, you know, having a personal website, you should view this as like having an Instagram account or a brand, because that's set, not owned by someone. And this is getting me to the broader topic of I'm experiencing what it's like to have my tooling not owned by a giant corporation and realizing, you know, that time investment to make it myself. Yeah, it's a lot. Other people can't easily maybe access it, but if I build it on the web, it should be easily accessible and it should be custom-built to what I need it to do. And I'm beginning to not think in terms of product mindset, but you know, that being said, there's so much to build, there's so much to create. I really do need a way to sort of organize, because unfortunately doing work happens one dimensionally. And there's so many dimensions to branch out in. I really do need to figure out a task management system or a way to turn these thoughts into task management, which is something I honestly do not have a good solution for yet, but I need to think about it. And I want to learn. I want to learn new stuff. So I need to figure out where can I go to learn.

 Okay, so I tried to enter into a meditative state and I got overwhelmed with excitement for what I was thinking. And I wanted to be in a place where I could narrate my thoughts while I'm doing the meditation. I first tried by trying to get into a field. And a curious thing happened at the field was virtual in the style of Xbox Live when I was maybe 10s. That's 2011. Simplified me like characters like the Wii. These were the first occurrences of the metaphors for me. A world where you had digital currencies, you had players who you resonated with their avatars and so on. When I played Xbox, I wanted to be my avatar. That was a whole economy there. And the important thing to own was games. And you'd go hang out with your friends by playing cooperative games. It was a social network. Video game platforms where the first social network I used. You can go through and escape. And with those platforms, you didn't have to be yourself. You could be whoever you wanted to be. And now with social media, you're almost forced to be yourself. And you can be creative, but you don't want to be called fake or corny. And if you scam people for money, it's not being genuine. There is very little space to be who you want to be, unless you're an artist, of course. But now I find myself in a video game of life, instead of one, about playing a fun game. The game is really hard to be fun, because normally in games you get rewarded for playing the game. Because that's what they learned. If you reward people for using a software or a product or a service, they will continue to use it. And that's very difficult to do. How do you make products, services, tools that reward the person for doing them? An education you might give them a sense of feeling accomplishment or a certificate, something like that. With games, we already understand that it's the reward system that don't be me built in. But what about social media? The number of followers, the number of likes, how much money you can make, how much attention you get. These metrics are very difficult and toxic. They should not be a measure of, should you post more, should not be a function of how well received is your content. I'm wondering about spaces where you show yourself, not the self that rewards you the most. And I think leaving those spaces will be very important for me, because I want to develop the things that I want the most, not that the world or whatever. So I think I may have to make the conscious decision to delete social media or just not access it. I have to use my computer to program, but I'm trying to think how much different would my brain be if I didn't have access to other people's work, other people's ideas, what other people want. What if I had to decide that on my own? I think it's going to be incredibly difficult to do, but it's necessary. I mean, that's the difficulty of this journal being, depending on technology. Is it really here to separate me from such? How do I make a more positive relationship with technology? That's what I want to know too. I feel constantly used for my attention. I don't like feeling like that. I feel constantly reminded of the ways in which I'm not adequate. I feel constantly reminded that I could always be doing something better than what I'm doing. It doesn't like make life miserable or it doesn't make me depressed, but it keeps me always chasing after something. And that something is using Instagram more. Because the ultimate way to get people to use your app is that if you associate positive feedback on that app with going up in life or getting better like when you get followers, there's a lot of incentive to use social media apps so much incentive. And it's really hard to compete with that. I don't know how to make an app that people want to use. I actually don't care. I just want to make cool things that help me. It seems like in order to get people to want to use it, there has to be a social media aspect, meaning an aspect of it that abuses human psychology to get an unreasonable amount of reward or attention. But guess what? I don't need people to use my app four hours a day in order for it to be important. I want to make things that you might use once a month or once a year. I feel like everything is being pushed towards how do you make the most addictive experience at all.

 So I've watched a couple videos on Agent AI stuff. It is very overwhelming because with all of these big companies and really smart collections of people, it feels like there's no way that I could build anything that no one has built before. But I have to remind myself that's not really the goal. The goal is to build something for me. It's to build a tool that is perfect for me and addresses the problems that I have. It is nice. There's going to be a lot of as we try to move towards AGI, the researchers, we're just going to keep making AI that can solve more and more problems. But I have that issue. I can solve a lot of problems. I can't do it as fast as an AI agent perhaps, but I can solve a lot of problems. The question is, what problems do you want to solve? And what problems can I solve in particular? And I think the thing that I have the most interest in right now is being able to understand how to make good decisions on any kind of thing. And that's a really general thing. What I mean by that is due diligence, some kind of scientific method, some workflow. I just want something which it's not just good at reasoning because I'm good at reasoning, but it's good at making really, really, really fine detailed decisions, not course decisions, but it's able to generate a whole community of thinkers that think through a decision with different points of view and all this different type of stuff that allows for good decision making ability. And I also want to understand how much do specific details affect decisions because there's some people who seem to have really good intuition, and they don't even need that much detail to make a great decision. As for what's next for me, I could use these agent AI and all that stuff and make cool things, but really it sounds like the goal is for the AI to do stuff on their own and for it to further help businesses or individuals do things. But really, I want to go back to what's my main goal right now, it's to have something that generates me money. So if I can make my own personal assistant that helps me run my business or my endeavors, that would be great. And what are the roles that I need right now? I need someone who's good at marketing strategy. I need someone who's good at monetization strategy. Someone who's good at managing me. I basically want to build the company that I don't work for using these AI capabilities and agents because if no one wants to hire me, I'll manage myself and I'll produce a product myself. I'll manage that product. I want to understand how businesses and companies work and I'll just run it my damn self. So that's kind of where I'm at right now.

 Something that's going to be difficult is if I have n journal entries, how do I find the connected components of them? I mean to abstract the problem, I have a graph with n vertices and I can, if I give you two vertices, assume that I'll be able to save their connected enough. I need to find a quick way to build this graph of connections without doing like, I don't know, n squared operations because no, it's n, it's n to the n, right? Because, and that's way too long as the number, I do not want the graph to take n to the n to build. I think what would be better is if, I mean, a different approach would be to chunk it. First cluster, I think clustering is a different way to say connected components, but I think I could cluster all at once, maybe by doing a vector embedding. So I do a vector embedding of the journal cluster it. Break those clusters up now. Okay, this is great. So the next order of business will be to make a vector database instead of an SQL database for my journal entries.

 And I'm realizing that I asked ChatGBT, you know, here's my thoughts, can you help me write it into an article? And it actually wrote what I said into a really nice way of saying it. But that kind of felt like plagiarism because that felt like someone else would say, not me. And I think that I can be me and a good writer at the same time. And I had no idea how am I supposed to know if someone else wrote this. And I don't know, and that's just their words being used. I have no clue, so I can't do that because I don't know if it's plagiarism or not. But what I can do is ask you to help me search for other sources and help me understand those sources so I can get an idea of who thinks like me already. And I'll do that. But then I realized just for writing the blog part, you could probably hire someone to do that. People who are good at writing. So I went on Fiverr to look at that. This place looks like crap. And it made me think, man, I wonder if I could just make a fake freelance writer and write blog articles for people using ChatGBT and stuff in my own custom content writing thing. Because who's to say that wouldn't get them their job? I mean, to do a quality job, I feel like AI can't. AI just sounds too similar. So if you can get something that doesn't sound like it was written by ChatGBT, it would be very valuable. Because people are not asking you to help write. A lot of time they're asking you to help write in a personalized way. But I don't understand content deeply. And I feel like it'd be easiest to maybe start with my mom or something instead. But like, holy crap, I'm realizing freelance AI agents are definitely going to be taking over. Good thing their work won't be that good if you aren't using it correctly. But someone, the first people that get good things are going to, how it's scary.

 I think a good YouTube video to start out with, I would enjoy it. YouTube is not, I remember it as a kid. I've been watching a lot in nostalgia content, and I'm thinking about this first YouTube video on a make about me and being personal, and I'm thinking about how shitty I feel because it's like I don't think I'll have enough, I don't think I'll be a star enough, it's become entertaining, I have to become entertaining. But the point of making the video is never to be entertaining. The point of the video was to share my thoughts and reach the people who I think would relate to me and gain value from that. And I believe that's a non-zero amount of people. But the problem is, I feel like if I don't, I'm simultaneously being bitter and saying something valid at the same point, which is, I don't feel like I'll be encouraged to keep making videos. But then again, in order for the algorithm to really work, I will need to make more content. Because you would think that the YouTube algorithm would work relentlessly to give each person the video that is most beneficial to them, or would be most interesting or relevant, and especially giving new perspectives a chance. But I feel skeptical and I believe that if the YouTube video gets sent to a batch of people and I don't immediately hit off whatever dopamine goes off in their brain, then I'm not going to get any views. And it's not that I want views, but it's that what's the point in communicating to a dark void, and especially what's the point in communicating to a dark void if I have to sell my soul. By all means, I'm open to becoming a better creator in terms of higher production quality, all that stuff. But why do I now have to become a company that has production value and dada dada, what about raw? And I know podcasts maybe are good for this, but I don't want to do a podcast. I want to make a video that can be watched and people can debate in the comments what my thoughts are. That would be great. I want to have a community. And I thought YouTube and social media were supposed to be the places to build communities, but I feel like the goal is not so much to build a community anymore. It's more to go viral or make money off people or jumpstart your business. And this is back related to the thing of I think thinking about money too much really takes the fun out of life because it just makes life about money. And oh my god, I'm facing like 10 million challenges all at once. And I can't express any of them. And the thing is I want to be able to make a YouTube video in one day. To me making a YouTube video is like a week long event and I have to do all this work just to make one little YouTube video. I already have the ideas. I'm going to start. I'm going to make a paper. I'm going to do all this stuff to try and make a good YouTube video. But it's my first YouTube video. I want to build community and now I'm being forced to do all this action work. I'll do it though. I'll do it. And I think that's honestly why there's like such a barrier. It's a temporary entry now that deserves to be there. But holy crap is it hard to overcome which is another thing.

 But you can see now with this, I want all of my thoughts to give back to me. And I want to make sure all of my thoughts are feeding back into motivating me and keeping me driven. And I notice and I'm happy I'm getting back into that headspace. Over that researcher you see Irvine, I was so... That problem, I've never been more intense in my recent life. And I saw that problem, I saw that problem in particular is really intimidating because so many other really good people have done things related to that. So it felt really hard to even feel special. But what I did was instead of thinking of how do I become really good, I simply thought how do I see nothing but the problem. How do I forget that someone else worked on it? How do I forget that I want to impress people? How do I forget everything but the problem? So that the only thought in my brain when I go to bed is the problem because the only thing that matters and I wish I would have recorded everything about what I was saying and thinking of that time because the only thing that matters was my personal relationship with the problem. It did not matter my position in the race of getting to the problem. All that mattered was my personal relationship with these ideas. And so I spent hours and hours a day just doing whatever I could to get a more personal relationship with the ideas. I would draw diagrams. I wouldn't read any papers. I wouldn't look at anyone else's doing. All I would do was generate as many questions and play around with as many things and ask and just it was just me and the problem. In fact, it didn't even matter that I was doing this in a context. All that mattered was I had this wonderful thing and I focused so deeply on it that I was able to think things that no one had thought before and make progress and have a level of insight, creativity, productivity that was just special. And I began to go back in that mode with this and I'm happy because that level of passion and motivation is to me what allows me to do special things. And the fact that I feel back there is really comforting to me. Let me save that.

 I'm thinking that instead of making potential to do's and jobs and that kind of stuff, it'd be better to identify key problems to solve. What key problems can I solve that will be useful to me? And by problem, I mean, what's something that I frequently or have alluded to that would is preventing me from being as good as I could be. Or what things have interested me? What kind of cool things have I mentioned that I would love to work on with endless motivation? How can I use those types of things? I really want to frame things in terms of problems. Questions. Not do this, do that. There's no room for creativity when it's just do this, do that. I'm thinking I want to rewrite my suggestion code to generate really good problems and questions from what I've said.

 So I found with I think is an orange pie. That's gonna be a pain that's to get working. I know I got working once before but I mean I don't know. I'm not the most enthusiastic about that setup because I don't know. Raspberry Pi just be easiest to do with support in community. I don't want my whole fucking livelihood saved on the orange pie. But it would be cool to get working and play around with it if I could. Have all these phones like now. I think for now I can just have my computer plugged into maybe a hard drive that saved stuff in. For now I'm in the next big thing is I'm not always going to be home. And I need to be able to record my phone might be dead. So I need to think of a dedicated device that's always ready to record me. Easy to charge, easy to plug in places, lots of storage, all that stuff. I mean I could probably build my own. But that's the next order of businesses. Look up a cheap recording device. Buy one of those so I can be manually uploading those, tagging them, all of that stuff.

 I... There's no reason at all that I should have gone to Caltech for more than four years. It's gonna be six. Gone all of this mathematics knowledge. Trained my brain to be an excellent problem solver. And I still have to take years to understand like, probability concepts. That's not fair. So, you know, I want to be able to learn better, quicker, faster than anyone else. Integrate that into my exact... Like, I want to know exactly what I should do with each of these skills. Exactly what skills in machine learning I should focus on. Because I don't want to just try and consume the whole textbook, you know. Even with building this app, it was basically heavily AI assisted on the coding part. But when stuff breaks, I know enough to fix it myself. But I think my perspective is, I don't want to hop into the talking. I can't... I can't... Breh, I talked to... Re-shard... Ricardo. And he's like so interested in all the little details. He doesn't actually care about making any product or tool or anything. Now, just try like his own things. He wants to know the algorithms and... Because he's a little autistic. Yeah, but... Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I've actually done a lot of... We're found it today, which is scary. Because I don't know what I want to... I don't know. Like, what do you think... What feature do you think... Or what... What thing do you think I could make that I would use every day going forward? Yeah, I mean, what... What thing do you think I could add to your app journal? We'll make it. I haven't had a need to go back to my entries yet, but I think the main thing that's... I'm not using is... The entries I've done already, like, I'm not using them. I should be incorporating what I've said to... I think all of my thoughts that I've already recorded are probably going to tell me what I should do next, right? Oh, my God, I'm so... I'm a thief. I'm a thief for doing stuff on my cracket. Damn, I have no school, I sleep like 9 hours a day. It's cold outside. You see what's going on in California?

 Okay, the recording on my phone was briefly broken. I don't know what happened, so I lost my previous message. But I just was saying that I'm about to sleep. I think I did a good job. What I want to do is, tomorrow is even find more ways to mind the day than find ways to start turning, getting things on that to do list. Pick, how to pick a next goal, as well as how to build some more tools that are going to help me achieve those goals, breaking down those goals into smaller chunks. I don't know, just whatever the next step is, we're going to do it.

 So I just woke up. I'm continuing my daily routine of starting my day by talking to my journal. I believe it's very useful. I'm not sure how I want my day to go, but I do know I want to work on my journal. I don't know what best to next work on. I had many ideas. The big broad thing is I want to get more insight out of my thoughts. I saw a lot of interesting projects like chat dev, chat dev that use multiple agents powered by LLMs to simulate a workspace in order to get higher quality outputs rather than just from the zero shot prompts. I think that's something to look into. I could use an existing framework for that or I could build my own, but I believe that'll take longer than a few hours. The main issue I have is there's a few hours of primark time in the morning that I think is ideal for problem solving. And I want to know which problems I should dedicate this ideal problem solving time to. Another thing that can be done is just the basic refactoring of the code to clean it up. Part of the reason it's annoying to implement new features is because the code is not easily expandable. A lot of copy and paste pull crap. I also want to learn more. A big thing I might like to do is make a personal website. I want to do that using node and JavaScript. I'll have to learn a bunch of new stuff there. I also want to have fun, but I do not want to spend the beginning hours of my day just watching YouTube videos or Instagram rails or learning stuff. I want to really be doing something and doing problem solving. Another interesting thing I found was that apparently there's this thing called llama processor, which is really good at processing documents to input into large language models like PDFs, especially math, mathematical equations and stuff. I think it would be good to start scraping math problems from textbooks. That would be interesting to learn from. Another interesting thing I was thinking about is just being in a journal and starting to plan out some ideas on how to best extract insight from my work, including workflows, data structures for like what is an idea, data structure. I'm most enthusiastic about doing this actually because it's like research. That's up my alley, so I'm thinking what's best is just hop in a notebook and just start writing while listening to some good music like I did at my research in Irvine, which reminds me one day I really want to unpack how I reached that level of just locked in that level of super research. I did at Irvine and will unpack that at some point. Another problem that apparently I learned is large language models seem to not listen to the middle of a prompt. When you have longer context windows, I think more than when you have more than seven K tokens in a prompt, they usually focus on the beginning and end of the prompt, which that reminds me another thing I wanted to do is put my journal into a vector database. As I understand it, this embeds the text into a vector space and the benefit of this is it allows you to ask questions which embed into this vector space. You can pick the nearest entries to this, which allows you to maybe search your journal quickly for the most related entries, which is useful for pre-processing the data you send to large language models. It allows you to not have so much noise that gets put into your prompts. I think this would be a really big return on investment, although I don't think I need to use my prime problem solving hours to do it. Otherwise, I'm feeling pretty good. I slept well. I lost one of my contacts because I took it out and lost it. That's kind of annoying, so I got to use another pair. I was worried a little bit that I don't seem to be on track to do get a PhD. I really want to get a PhD in mathematics, but I want to fill out the applications to do such, but while my academic status is in limbo, while I don't know about how I should answer disciplinary stuff on the application, it's really hard to be enthusiastic about such. I'm going to be patient and understand I have time for that. I think the main thing I need to do is just focus on finishing my bachelor's, which I'm doing, and crossing my fingers that things go right for that as well as doing the necessary work. I also have to finish that financial aid crap so I don't put a hold on my account. I mean, they will put a hold on my account, but I got to get it lifted. Those are my main stressors and also the big stressor of I want to be successful and it's hard to deal with that.

 I'm realizing paradigm for how all of this is really, if you for a moment realize where in the business of generating, so I mean every machine learning model basically works from trying to learn a distribution and then generating generating something from that distribution, that's how you get generative AI. I'm basically trying to generate useful documents and stuff from my journal, but the thing is I'm not trying to generate new stuff. I'm simply trying to transform my jumbled up words into these documents with a, you know, pretty faithful representation of my style, my tone, all this stuff. And I think the difficulty in that is I'm not training the exact way in which I talk or the exact cadence of my words, which is what I fear is getting reflected. What I really want to give feedback to is whatever the best processed data that the large language model needs and explaining the structure I want to format in. And basically I want to preserve my ideas while changing the, I want to preserve my ideas while changing the medium. And if the information for the medium is not yet there, I want to be prompted to fill it in. So I think a lot can just be taken straight from what I'm writing, but more than something that responds to the text, I want something that searches through the text, grabs the relevant information, gives the relevant information to the, and I want everything to have citation. So I have to make my own internal reference system. How am I going to reference things? I have to now put my work on an absolute timeline or an absolute place in which I can reference my information. I don't know how I'm going to do that because the data is so unstructured, the only references I have are those for the time. But because I'm the author of everything, I don't know where to cite things. So I think what I need to be doing is now making formal documents, which I can cite later. So I need to make a document for any big idea I have and build that document. So I have my own internal knowledge base. So I should figure out the set of documents I should spend generating to be reference for my opinions, beliefs and guiding principles. And then ask based on searching through that knowledge base. So I think the thing to do is instead to just have my raw thoughts begin to process them into a bunch of useful documents to be referenced as for a knowledge base later. So that's on the to do.

 So as you just saw, I think I'm beginning to see something quite amazing because there's the issue I saw of and especially when I talk to Melissa, this becomes obvious. There's so many YouTube videos books about how to start doing something and you can get in the place where you read how to start doing something for like 500 hours. In order to build the thing you wanted to start doing, it could have been a hundred hours. You've spent 500 hours studying zero hours doing so now you haven't done it right? And what I'm realizing is I'm thinking to do that. Imagine all the cool things I could do. But really the way you learn how to make something is you build it and I'm using it. Now I'm using them saying, oh look I've produced so many general entries and I have to scroll through to find the one I want. Man it just be better if I had a way to just like pull up the thing and I want it. But now this is where the real benefit of making myself is. Imagine I'm using Apple's app. When you use someone else's app, you're like, man, I wish there was a way that this could happen. Then you have to like if you're really really dedicated, you email the people and say, hey can you do this? But then they have to make an app that is good enough for like a millions of people. So they might say, hey your brain works stupidly. We're not going to add that in. Or they might say, yeah, you can already do that. But if you do these other 15 steps, you'll be it's like, man, but now with me, I'm like, man, I wish this was the case. All I have to do is go up to my computer, write a few lines of code and it solves the problem. And I think I'm beginning to realize that's how you make something useful. Yeah. You I'm I think I'm seeing why they say make it a problem that is in your life. Because now I'm solving the problem. And I'm like, oh, this is great. I've already solved the problem. And then I'm just like, oh, wait, there's another problem. Let me solve that problem. Instead of thinking, what would it what thing would need to exist in order for this to be useful? And I'm in the position where I can actually build my journal because I'm now wanting to really think what is a journal and why even though I've not been able to keep that habit, I feel journals before, especially mathematics, my ideas so easy. Why is it even though this thing which I find so fruitful to do? Because I know years, I'll be so happy I kept a journal because it's it's important to get a track of, to me, a journal is like your your data about what was going on in your brain. And that gets to the essence of what what is a journal and why am I wanting to build one? Because I need to know what's in my head. But look, I've reduced all of the crap of journaling to something that actually works for me.

 Say what you're saying? I want to use this then to go and talk to like, well this is still zero zero. So it's not recording. It's recording. Yeah, so I'm going to talk to say Mrs. Amunds and just talk about her life and then talk to, you know, to Jan Connor, as long as need be. And then that way, I don't have to take notes. It can just then right away transcribe these things. And that's the thing is, and this is not Eric talking, those miles talking, the thing is that technology has existed for a long time. You've always been able to do speech. But the thing is, it's really annoying because the issue isn't that we now turn it to Texas, but now you have a huge block of text. What are you going to do with that, right? It's just easier to save the audio at that point. It's where people start sending audio message. But the reason why I'm turning it into text is because I never journal. Journalist text. And the wonderful thing about text is you can search it. You can put it into GPD. And so now what I'm going to do is get all of my audio turning to text so I can do a bunch of cool stuff with it. For example, I'm going to say, the first thing I want to do by another day is today is, every day when I wake up, like I said, I want to be able to speak to my phone, hit that, and then boom, it gives me a to-do list. And you know what? I think Apple is going to make this on the next day going to beat me to it. But you know what? I don't care because I don't want Apple's version. I want my version. And it's going to give me a to-do list. All this different stuff, I want to make my own journal. This is me putting the binding on my own journal, my own perfect journal. And so I'm really going to make it for me more than anyone. And I'm even going to do a bunch of stuff that, oh, me, I will be able to do. And this scary thing is, I'm now realizing, oh my God, the new iPhones are going to have all of this next year. But you know what? That's not a bad sign. That's a sign that I'm the future. But yeah, so what it's going to, the real secret sauce, this is already useful to me because it's saved it to my computer. I don't have to use any one else's devices. But the real secret sauce to me will be able to do a bunch of analysis on all my entries. And they'll give me useful information out of my gibberish. That's on the doob. Yeah, cool.

 I'm wondering about the California fires and what investment and how money should be moved in order to put money into companies and infrastructures that will be in charge of repairs and what other things will be impacted from the fires in order to be invested in. I used perplexity to do that. I mean, I don't want to do due diligence. I wish I had an idea of how the economy worked and how what businesses in particular are responsible for the fires. I could probably spend a day researching that or making a way to figure that out. It's probably worthwhile.

 Do you remember how I buy those raspberry pies? You know, raspberry, it was like those little green boards. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to go find them because I would buy them to learn how to use them, but I wouldn't, I would want to have a project, but I didn't have a real project. I finally have a use, which is, I need a little computer, which is dedicated to just doing my journal. Oh, I'm a loose, yeah. So I want to plug it in, put it, like basically glue it to the router, or whatever. And that's going to be my journal. That's going to be where all my, I'm going to plug in a hard drive. And that's just, or a flash drive. My text is so cheap, you can put all text. And I just want to have all of my, I want to have a journal where my thoughts are saved somewhere here. Because I don't want my thoughts to be owned by Google. Yeah, I'll put a copy of my thoughts in Google. But I want, at the end of the day, if Google says, hey, you can't get your thoughts anymore, I want to have a thumb drive. Because I'm thinking, imagine a thumb drive with all of your thoughts. But it's stored in such a way that's easily searchable, right? I'm going to be carrying around a little thumb drive with my thoughts all the time. Because the real, the real, well, to me, the real benefit of, of like carrying your soul with you or something. Exactly. My brain is the computer. My brain is the object that should be taking care of. And I'm thinking even about that, if dad had done something like this, where basically everything he said was ever recorded, you'd be able to understand that's not so well if you had. I think there's a number of words. And I'm, imagine like a book. This would be a thick book, right? For references like maybe three inches, thick book. That book would take a long time to read. That's going to be nothing for the amount of words I'm going to produce after a year, right? And I'm saying that to say in all of those texts, there's going to be a gold mine. And I'm going to have to mine my own thoughts for text. But the problem is when it's, or for gold, when the thoughts are in my brain, I can't run computer code on my brain to pick things out. But if I get my brain onto a piece of paper, which is what journaling is supposed to be, the reason that the thing that pissed me off about a journal is how to use a journal. You have to flip through. And if you're really smart, you'll figure out an organization system and you'll invent a table of conducts. Basically, the best journal in the world, the most easy to use journal for later reference, just turns into a textbook. But the thing is how the healthy right a textbook when you need to have raw thoughts, right? So the problem is I need, I'm basically trying to make my brain searchable. I'm just going to sit there and talk to myself for 30 minutes at a time, about all of my thoughts on the world. And that I think I'll add, I'm going to, in every time I go and call with someone, I'm going to put this there. And I'm going to actually, I was thinking, I need to have a, I'm going to go buy a thing that's a dedicated little microphone. I think if you had all those when you were talking to spite, I was on end. Yeah, I'm going to see on Amazon as a little bit, because I want to have something like the thing is, it's so tempting to make one device that does everything, which is why phones are so nice to me, because I can record, I do everything on the phone itself. But I need to now think of a pocket solution, where I'll have a little microphone that I can charge and I just have it on me all the time. I want to be recording everything, like everything. I want to record every single word I say, until the day I die now, every word needs to be recorded. Oh my gosh, you know, you didn't win me off somebody. This is so crazy. I did not be mushy. I'm saying anything. I'm just saying you're mind me off somebody. Let me ask you about this thing that, correct me. I wish your dad was here. He would be the only one who could laugh with me about. Oh my gosh, first move, we'll find a breakup in LA. No win.

 Well, what I do is I speak out my sermon and I hit the dictate button. There's a dictate button on my thing laptop and it transcribes my sort what I'm saying but what I use it for is to check the way I am pronouncing words because that way sometimes like I just said GPD so that way I'm aware that I need to say GPD you know that kind of thing so it helps me to recognize the words that I say in a way that might transcribe the subtitles come out funny but you've been different models this is now Eric speaking I really got a designer thing that notes itself make it so it can distinguish multiple people talking but I want different models are able to find that so in the future they'll be able to know exactly what you're saying regardless the problem is a lot of the models are just trained on people that don't speak like you but you could actually train the model exactly for you and so I don't the thing that I realize is having it from my use cases having exact transcription for example Miss Amman's I don't think it spoke the name correct but then again that's because that's a specific name if you think about how a model is trained trained on a bunch of general information yeah how the hell would it know how who amends is right and so what I'm gonna the switch I'm gonna do that as I'm gonna make a thing which is gonna be able to detect characters are people and then it's gonna ask you are these people please fill in their names correctly and then it's gonna even allow you to say who they are in your contacts so then like I was telling my friend what I really want to be able to do is have a personal assistant which is keeping track of my life for me but this is exactly what Apple Intelligence is gonna do which is I'm so mad because which is so great because people like us this is not Eric's mother talking it's gonna be so good because like let's say when we're talking with with um with Andy about Sophie and saying the problem is going to be how does Sophie gets managed Sophie's day-to-day life because Sophie does not know when to go to the doctors when to go to the dentist when to get their car and I'm like oh my gosh I am Sophie but anyhow so but this is going to be that manager yeah and I want to have that and it's gonna take a second but like I said I've learned that building this Eric talking sorry building tools has come down to doing piece by piece yeah so like I had to do piece by piece of this I said okay let me start with a page with a button now let me make the button do something now let me make another button which is something now what I want to do is I just want to start with a to-do list I want to speak to my phone it's a very simple prop speak to my phone about how my day to go and it's gonna give me the to-do list because guess what I hate making the to-do list but I love talking about what I want to do in my day it's just that's not a list okay I want to but not

 So, I thought of a pretty cool thing to talk about. I basically want to say why we need to fund smart people, brilliant people to make art and not make products. You know, just a little bit why I'm thinking about this. I want to think it's important for all of us because basically bottom line is big companies are stealing all of the talent, the technical talent. They can throw money at people which money makes you reevaluate what's important to you. You'll put your happiness aside to take a good paycheck. And that's scary because who's doing hiring people with money? Not necessarily good people or people who have our best interests in mind, just people with the most dollars to give to the most technical people. And we can live in a world where we hope that the wealthy have our best interests in mind collectively. But I'm suggesting we should also make a world where we intentionally fund really smart people to do stuff that's not obviously useful. Because is it should we really believe that the smart person should be funded to only make products for other people or that if they wish to make their own product they have to make a competing company against the people who make lots of money? I would actually hope that let me take a step back and talk about mathematics research because I initially wanted to pursue a career in academia. When you think about what why I went into mathematics, well in middle school I didn't really think math was super interesting but I said to people I wanted to be a mathematician because it was the thing I was best at in terms of it kept my attention the most. I didn't really pay attention in any other class but math class I paid attention. It was easy to pay attention in math class. It's not even that I liked it. But then when I transferred schools to a pretty nice suburban school in Illinois, Chicago suburbs, I previously was in Wisconsin. It wasn't a bad school but just the elitism and all of that wasn't as high. But in the Chicago suburbs it was pretty competitive and all of a sudden your ability in school and your ability in mathematics was a direct relationship to your life trajectory, how valuable your life will be will it be good. And so I tried to be in these math programs I was initially denied but I studied outside of school, actually studying to learn algebra one by myself, took summer school to be put in an accelerated math track. And I decided I liked math but at the same time I realized I was just you know I'm biracial, my mother's canyon, my dad was English and that meant I had to understand this concept of race at some point. And the first time that I understood that I may be this thing called black, it was not really a positive experience because I found it out by you know people making jokes about niggers and black people and MLK dying. And in reaction to that I went and I learned a lot about this different history. I became proud of the roots that I had that were you know black and African even though I was already proud but now I had this associated story of oppression and struggle related to it that even if I was an African American I could still go back to Kenya, see all of the smart people and ask myself can you should can you should be like the US these countries in Africa the people aren't better. There's worse conditions in a lot of places in Africa but like the people aren't stupider. I mean I know there's claims about the bell curve and stuff but there's a lot of incredibly intelligent people in Africa. But and I was supposed to believe that being an American and being a white American was supposed to be the best thing ever but honestly I would I would prefer to leave. I mean a lot of stuff was crappy but I liked the education. The education notably was something that I couldn't get when I'd visit my grandparents the schools in the area I would be like five years ahead of their math curriculum and so I began to value the US for its education. But anyway I watched this movie called The Man Who New Infinity about Ramana John, The Mathematician and I fell in love. This guy who you know had this relationship with mathematics that didn't have to do about production or anything you just sort of like would be in love with a problem or even just be so deeply connected to these mathematics problems that it was entangled with who he was as a person in his life in a beautiful movie and I decided there was something in that movie about one plus two plus three plus four and so on equals negative one twelfth. And that was you know how could that be that's not true. And because I wanted to know how I wasn't true I looked up a video and there's this German mathematician who goes under the YouTube moniker mathologer that's M-A-T-H-O-L-O-G-E-R. I made this interesting video I didn't understand any of it but all I knew was the person who knew a lot of math said it was nonsense and that was very interesting. Long story short I don't want to do math because I'm gonna get paid that stuff is so interesting. But now I find myself saying well I don't want to just be an academia because I don't like being a student. I'm actually a very bad student I don't like going to class I only like working on things I'm interested in I don't want to work on problem someone else gives me but I was a good enough student to make it to Caltech where I have struggled because I'm not a good student that way but I'm still just as passionate and I'm still just as capable but I have to be learning what I want to learn I'm not that capable at learning a bunch of things other people want me to learn I have to have my own personal call to that information but I don't believe that just because I can't work on what someone else wants me to work on that's reason that I shouldn't be allowed to pursue mathematics but it does make me very not employable and that's a big problem because now I'm forced to think I'm going to leave try and leave mathematics so that I can be come employed because I don't want to be in school because I already said I hate school but to be employed means you have to now be useful and be productive and work on what you're told to work on which almost feels like what I had issue with school except school seems to people say it's better but I'm thinking man if I just had the resources to work on what I want to work on I'd work on stuff regardless I don't need someone to pay me to work on something and the thing I might make yeah it may not be useful to people it may not make a billion dollars it may not harvest people's attention it may not take away money from people that need it but it'll be interesting to me and I would have learned and all I care about is learning more and now I'm told well you have to do some kind of job and that job or whatever it is you have to spend something doing many hours of your life not by choice and I sound selfish I do but the thing is I want to spend all of my time trying to make things that help other people but in order to get a job at a company that'll say the exact same thing I have to do this rat race to convince them that I want to have no I want to help other people and I'm capable that should be enough as a human to place you into a place you can do that job and that's why I'm saying we should fund more smart people to create art because to me art is the place where the goal isn't really to produce or to make money but to be in touch with what it is to be a human what it is to exist and present those things in some art art to me has been some of the most healing and transformative stuff ever from music to to films I've film I remember I took a class where it was talking about film was originally you know like you can use it for science you want to video stuff to understand phenomena you can play things back in slow motion you can zoom in on things film is one of the most useful scientific tools but it was ended up becoming when we think of film now we mainly think of art and movie and entertainment and same with music all of these technologies that were invented from electromagnetism to do microphones and recording and and to make all these different types of instruments in EDM they all come from a scientific place and a lot of places you know department of defense and government labs make these types of things but my point is art and innovation as a society are linked and I want to be more on the side that helps that transition from science to art rather than be the person but now AI now we get to artificial intelligence in particular the devil the elephant in the room artificial intelligence right now there is such a black hole taking all of the people who are genuinely interested and capable to push artificial intelligence forward there is a black hole sucking in people into a small community as to not let the rest of us know where artificial intelligence is without chat GPT being released I don't even know if I would know how far ahead large language models are and I'm saying there's this really interesting thing of I think scientists who are at the cutting edge need to be talking with artists who can understand how those tools can be used to make to make transform art even more in the way that video and film transformed art there was paintings before and there was plays but film kind of allowed art to be accessible because when there's paintings and plays only rich people can go to can see the in our society at least now we don't you need to rely on museums and stuff not everyone can see art if it's just a painting or a play but everyone can watch movies online now you know I'm not advocating for piracy but I'm just saying you can get movies for free if you have access to the internet you have access to that art and yes we need to find a way to pay the people that make the art that's not the argument I want to be talking about but I'm saying that this AI and these things like that could be ways to transform art even more but the technical background that people say you need to have is very scary and it also gets people to replace their PhDs and they think they shouldn't listen to artists because now you become a snob and you and you you have this hubris as a scientist or computer scientist or mathematician that you actually understand what art is better because you're so smart no I want to talk to people that do art have no idea how any of these technologies work have no idea how mathematics works and they just tell me what do they want to make and I think how do I help you make that that's what I want to do I want to just talk to someone who wants to make something and they don't know how and I want to see if I can help them that's simply what I want to do

 Wow, I just want to take a moment to reflect on that. It was really annoying to do all of that development because things broke and my chat GPT stopped letting me use it because I reached the quota. But then I started doing it by myself and I was able to piece together the puzzle which made me feel really good about myself. Basically, the issue was, I was, help me notice things. I was uploading twice the database once when I uploaded the audio and then twice when I uploaded the transcription. So I fixed that. I also learned a little bit about how the SQL works. But man, just taking a step back, that was intense. That sucked. But I feel really happy with the result. I feel rewarded. I have topics. I have keywords. I have custom topics now. And I have a cute little algorithm for doing that. I had the idea of I should first sort into a bunch of broad topics and then choose the individual sub topics which I did. I also noticed I'm not even doing the pre-processing of the audio. I'm just transcribing the peer audio which I think is probably fine. But holy crap, that was intense and I'm happy with what I have though.

 So, man, I am so annoyed because I called my friend to tell him we talked, but one thing that I told him is him, okay the matrix kind of opened up for me, in that once I started building my journal, I've started to use everything on the internet and begin to think, how hard would it be to do this myself? And it turns out I think a lot of applications I could make myself in a week, like something as simple as a notepad. A notepad doesn't make money, but it's an essential part of a computer, right? And I was like, well I could make my own notepad. I think I understand how to make applications a bit better now and I see it's possible. Would it be the best notepad? No, could I make my own and would it be useful to just say I have my own? Yes. Now, the... You can also choose the level at which you call it your own. What I mean by own is I own the intellectual property. And what I'm realizing is for a product that someone owns, they own that product, they own the idea and they own a lot of things. A lot of the time, right? But there's a level where if you break up the idea enough, it's made of pieces that no one owns. For example, logic, no one owns logic, but this is made of logic and the way in which you arrange that logic you can put ownership on, right? But if you take it down to the pieces that no one owns and rebuilds it yourself using the pieces no one owns, you can say you own your own notebook. Until you start selling it to people, then people will claim, actually, no, you already own that idea. My point is, I told my friend Disney said, well, now that you see how easy it is to make apps, we can see why I've been obsessively trying to get... He said, there might be people who do a pizza company and they know everything about pizza and they know nothing about websites and he's getting them to try and host their website through him. And I was thinking, it's so hard for me to step out of my brain and think in terms of a human being that could not make their own website. And I'm going to go make my own website, but to me, it makes zero sense how someone couldn't make their own website that does exactly what they want. But I'm beginning to remember, even if people are capable, who the hell wants to make a website? He's boring to most people. And so he's saying, well, we can immediately be getting our first customers just by telling other people, do it for them. And I told him, that's a great point, except I hate that part. I want to do the making of the thing. I don't want to be going door to door trying to get other people to use the thing. Which what was annoying me was I was realizing I like doing, which makes me, you'd want me at a company. But the problem is I don't want to boss. So I'm like this super employee who doesn't want to be employed by anyone. And I'm think I was just getting really annoyed, but I feel like all of the reasons you give someone a lot of money. I feel like I have those, not because I'm trying to be arrogant, but because I feel like there's people who make $20,000 a year. And I'm beginning to remember it has nothing to do with how smart you are. It has to do with what jobs are available. And the thing that's making me really annoyed is if I wanted $10,000, the most absolutely certain way would probably be to try and pick up some kind of cashier job or something nearby. And probably or a barista or something. If it was really about money and we're trying to pick up jobs, but the thing that I'm trying to also implicitly do, and I realized I didn't specify this enough to my AI was I do not want to be giving my time away for free. The reason I really like these projects is because I'm not making money right now, but I'm learning so much about the fact that I know I could make an app if I wanted to because I'm making my own that knowledge that I could do that and saving it somewhere so I have it on a portfolio or something that is invaluable, right? Because later down the line I can tell someone, yeah, I made my own journaling app. I know a lot about how I, that's valuable. But if I say I worked for an hour doing this, I would learn a lot. I mean, a lot of people would learn about that specific industry, but that's not an industry I know how to reliably continue my goals with. So I'm trying to think about ideas not just that make money in the next month, but that make money in something I want to do and I learn a lot doing them because I want to be rewarding in every which way and I historically have done things which are very intellectually rewarding, but not monetarily rewarding at all. I've had to rely on competitions and things like that to say I've made any money. But let me.

 I'm also realizing it'd be easier if I could like tag the user. So at the homepage or whenever you access the record page, I want them to put in a name like as soon as you open web page and I don't know or like an account. So you should have a name and a password and I'll save all that information locally for now since everyone who uses this is someone I don't know and I will say don't use a password for anything else. So yeah I just want to be able to tag who's uploading stuff and keep track of that.

 Listen, I'm talking about I told her I want to fix the UI. She said I should put yeah fall over the page Just cute. I'm more thinking about like I want the buttons like his buttons really the way But these are questions actually start playing around with Should people be using a press and hold feature on their phones or do you just might have this? I don't think it's recording. Oh, it is recording and then my mom thought it wasn't because she's on zero zero She doesn't even know why that I think you should hold down yeah, peer I like yeah, I also wanted because it'll only be recording whole conversation Oh, so you like so and I leave out the like a voicemail thing Hmm, that's really good to you. I feel like you should try you can't like a button says yeah, peer and then What the the pause thing and then the play button thing? Well, I'm gonna do isn't gonna make an account system So I can have an account you can have account you could do me a favor by trying to use it And then telling me how it was hard to use and then that'll be a review In can help with design Yeah, but we gotta have a discussion about that because you're gonna run a time I'll let you know my death philosophies Because it's not aesthetically Would a functionality over everything absolutely so if the aesthetic makes it hard to use Yeah, no, that's stupid. I'm thinking like I like The click button and true right now the benefit of having everything in a bunch of buttons is it's easy to like change stuff If I do some crazy advanced test features stuff, I'll like give me more things that I could break That is true, which is why I'm saying it might be Because at the end of the day, it is really for me So if it doesn't work for me Then I failed so I'm gonna start by making it great for me and then making it adjusting it for other people but like Right now The thing that I think is in the way of this is in order to make a yeah, I've made so many buttons Now I gotta click the tag and every single time I click the app tag. I should just be able to like Hit the button should be one button. Oh, oh you want to be one button. I just want it to be like you should be able to go As quick as possible to Yeah, that's what I thought okay Right, I know I know we said we discussed this later, but No, you could just go to now. I'm just saying I know I'm just saying what's on my mind obviously I doubt this to come to fruition But just just a little bit So be like How she's pencil so it's like yeah here Or you click it then it turns into And that's to stop them and then it turns into okay, you cannot upload button or Record again or something like keep going Hmm are like I know start keep starting or I don't know if they want to make it one entry Yeah, that's good for them because you it should be like it's a sequence. Yeah, you write that you can't really Hit stop unless you hit start and you can't hit upload unless you hit you know say sorry That's true With the you To the UI UI And the user the hard part is I know nothing about coding except for their job was script So I'm gonna do that. I want to start simple so it doesn't get too alarming like right now I'm not using the screen space well on desktop But then again, I mean like nice you why it's so hard to do this shit because I like it because I can use it I know I test for and I was like test for this shit is so ass You see I have a little mouth as has talking Yeah Yeah, I'm gonna again this need be an extra It's my imagination running for you I got this will again coming to first and the reason I was like not like this great is cuz I'm like how the fuck was I make that? I'll put yeah I'm just fake again. I'm big extra I wish I could like know how to code that Me too me too Go do me a week What's going to take me a week by days then To let all I code that I love to see it My name I like the challenge Could be stop record I'm better soon we start on and keep the quiet okay this from my own benefit I get you in a rush what you feel so you're gonna see what happened No, it stopped no, it didn't oh it stopped

 Man, this is pretty cool. I mean, I already just want to be yapping into this stuff. The hard part is, you know, I don't want it to get lost. And I've got to figure out the best storage solution. But, I mean, I want to save it in a JSON so that I can do, like, data analysis later. I want to be able to, like, search through things. One feature I was thinking of is, you know, have it detect names or characters. And then I'll ask you, maybe, like, to change those names in case they're transcribed wrong. And then that way you can get, like, a real narrative going on in your life. Because what I really want to make is a journal that is true to life. So I don't really have to be the one in charge of updating my journal. And my journal is already knowing what's going on. You know, it's going to learn me. It's going to be, this is a scary idea, because if it works, you know, there's a lot of privacy concerns. But if it's just for me, this is going to enable me to be really in control of my life. It's basically going to be a super personal assistant. I just got to keep building features. I mean, it feels like it's going to be a crazy, good idea. But it's definitely going to be my baby, which means it's going to be hard to sell to other people. Because it's going to be so tuned to my brain. But that's exactly what I want to make it.

 So now when I think about what are the decisions? What kind of places do I want to end up? Well, one, I want to get a living wage so I can support myself without burdening my mother. That's a big deal. Two, I want to have an upward trajectory in life. Like I want to feel like my life is going, you know, good or like at least it's going up right. You know, if not just to pay back the people that tried so hard for me to get here. I want to learn as much as possible. That's just I'm super curious because I feel like to even survive, I need to know what is, how does everything work? I want to innovate. So once I know how does that stuff work, how can I make it better? Or improve? I want to create, you know, once I've improved everything, now I want to use those things to create cool stuff. So I use, so I make tools to make tools to make art. That's what I want. And art might be a tool. And then once I've made that art, I want to enjoy other people's stuff, right? So I would say we survive, we thrive. I learn, I innovate, create and then I enjoy. That's my trajectory here. But I'm getting stuck because this support oneself, I haven't figured it out. And it's causing me a lot of pain because how it's a simple question. Is there a way for me to make a livable wage and be create the thing, do the thing from scratch that makes me money? Is that possible? Or should I really go have someone else pay me to use my skills for what they need? Because the question that I'm ultimately asking is, I have the skills. That's not the question. And if I don't have the skills, I can acquire them. I've demonstrated that. But people with skills are employees. So I am an employee. Because you want to employ the person with the skills to do the things you can't. Because I can do stuff other people can't. And that's valuable. Well, I'm not an employee. I'm a job. I'm a mathematician. But the thing that you have to think is for every person that gives a dollar, there's someone who wants, every person that takes a dollar is someone who wants to give that dollar because it will not waste their time. But my question is, I want to be an employer. Which means I need to know, I need a thing that I already know how to make money, to make money or make the thing or be sustainable and just use that money to hire people, that money to grow. So the key thing here is that you need, in order to make this money, sounds nonsensical, I need to figure out what makes money. But I have some constraints in condition to satisfy. Simply put, I don't want to do bullshit. I need no crime. Like no obvious violent any of that type of crime, no swindling, no hustling, no stealing, no lying cheating steal, blah blah blah. Which means no business, bull crap. None of that. I want to do it by improving something or creating something that helps other people with what they are going through in their life. So that's a big point here. And that's really hard because improving people is not a good business model. That's a terrible business model. The things that sell are the things that draw people's attention. So getting money to me has been related to this concept of getting attention. If you can get attention, then you're the most valuable person in the room because everyone needs more customers. And the most valuable person in the world is the most valuable person in the world. Because they own everyone's attention or a lot of people. Billions of people's attention. Which means they will just siphon all of the money of people who want to get more customers. But in a world where we for a moment we believe they can get you those more customers. Because the algorithm, this might be the easiest time to start a business. So let's for a moment assume that meta has a great way of getting you sponsored posts. You want to get sent to an audience that perfectly receives your content. You want it to be personalized. Because you want when that user interacts with that advertisement, you want to make a bond right away. So ideally, actually, if you grow the Instagram page for your business instead of do sponsored posts, it's basically the same problem. Because if you grow the page, grow social media, it's the same as getting people's attention. Which is the same as getting clients. Which is the same as getting money. So the understandably so most important thing to do if you want to make money and be an online person is grow your social media. Grow a social media account. Now this is really hard because social media seems to be inevitably tied to the person running the account. They don't want you to run a faceless account anymore. But a faceless account would be what I want. But how does a faceless account have personality? You need to show some faces. But I don't want people who follow me to know what I'm up to. Or if they do, I want them to think it's those types of people I have to impress. So as a key point, people in my life, I think I need to send them a certain message. And that message might be not what I want to say in my whole thing. Distract me from becoming public. Okay. Two. I don't know what to post. I feel like I'm not interesting in a social media way. But if I really lean into myself as a person and find my own niche, it'd be great. So I need to find my own niche. But the problem is if I make an audience of myself, none of us are going to give me any money. Won't pay me. Unless I find me from the future. Or I'm selling a course. Selling how to become me. But the thing is I wouldn't buy a course. I'd buy a tool. But I'd buy a tool. A book. I definitely would get a book. I wouldn't buy the book. But I'd read the book. Basically, I'd listen. How do I turn that listening into money? I have no clue. Because education is not something that I believe everyone should pay for. But how are you supposed to support educators who are not funded by the government or whatever? So we need to find a way to fund independent educators who are not and not charge students. Okay. So and basically we have no grant. That's a very hard problem. I don't want to solve that one yet. Okay. I mean, the obvious things are to say, can you make a platform, all that type of stuff. I don't know. Okay. But what app or tool or book could one make? One thing that I guess for me is getting into ML, SAS, and all that from non-technical place. Or, you know, unraveling the jargon to the public. Yeah. So an interface from me to people not like me where there's a need to, we have experts so called, right? Then we have people that don't, don't know because they don't care. Don't know. Don't care. But it will affect them. And this information doesn't really go that fast to those people because the way they talk sucks and all this stuff and it's hard to be on the experts. But we really want to care what does it mean for me. And I don't want to be an AI dooms person. That's bad. I don't want to just say the world's ending, your job's going to get replaced. Maybe I'd rather talk about a future for good AI. And what it could do. But the need for these big companies to not ruin that. Which means we need more AI education. But the problem is the companies are taking all the AI people. AI away. Making it so you can only do AI if you want money. Okay, that is an excellent article. Basically an article on why AI won't be good. But it could be. I would love to write about that. Okay, so I've thought a lot of interesting stuff. I don't want them to understand it as the whole point of what you're here for.

 Just as an observation, I'm watching a video on FASS, that's Facebook's AI for similarity search. Something like that. But he's describing an algorithm where to search through all these vectors in the space, you first compute the Voronoi diagram that's VOR and OI. And then compute the closest centroids and then search through the cells of those centroids. And this is a common pattern I've known in a lot of algorithms is a hierarchical setup where first you combine the data into chunks. So maybe you have like a million data points and you chunk them all into batches of let's say a thousand and then you search through the chunks of a thousand and maybe you only care about two chunks. So you reduced your search from a million points to 2000 points, which is really good. I just wanted to note that kind of setup for algorithms.

 So, when I'm able to accomplish so far, well, it was a small thing. I'm better talk to them I make practice. Did we get out? I did not. Huh? I did not. I did not know who to play at. No, that's my council grocery shopping with you. Whoever later, but did we? What did was, I just think you know what was good, so I can work with that. Yes. Right. And another. I think this is it. Yeah, it's all in here. I think I realized something that to me, there's certain things that I get to just have like a base of calories. So, I feel my stomach basically. Yeah. And until you said all that, I didn't realize I think what's that. Because I think this might be mine. I cannot eat a lot because I think about things that are feeling more than I think about a bunch of nutritious stuff. Yeah. Because to me, pasta, oatmeal, bread, are the things that will take quite. I don't know if this is what it works, but in my head, those are my stomachs. I'm not asking for food for the cookies and for a while. I think carbs help you have like that long term energy. So, I think I always looked to grab a car. And now that I know I have bread, I can work with that. I think it's toasted bread. And now I'm going to try the brownie. I like it, it's my specialty. So, I can do probably with olive oil and take it around high. And make the breakfast which I can use it. Yeah. But I'll do olive oil, garlic olive oil, corn different. Yeah. And then I can probably make some nice eggs with put on it with some maybe tomato, really. But anyway, what I did is I worked on this is going to be really good. This is going to make me take those sides apart. What I did was there was basically a technical bug. And I wanted to take it into a technical bug was because I don't think it would be that useful to use to know. I wanted to make a technical thing. But the technical bug was... Yeah. I'm going to start with the next one. I'm going to start with the next one. I'm going to start with the next one.

 So I've done a lot of work on the app today and I think I'm happy with what I'm accomplished and I'm probably going to move on to just living the rest of my day now. I got to do laundry, Frank from church just invited me a Melissa for dinner today from 6 to 6.30 pm, which gives me an idea. I need to turn you into a personal assistant so that you can hear dates and times and people and turn that into a calendar for me. That would be great. We're going to do that later though. Next, yeah, I'm basically building my own app-land intelligence here. Next I also need to figure out how to access this from when I'm not on my home network. I don't want to publish this website for the masses to see but I would like to maybe find a way that I can securely access this home network from outside of being on this Wi-Fi or if there's a website that I could make that I don't, I just get access to see the entries and it's like you have to log in, it's not hackable, that would be great. I'll ask Tess for about that. Yeah, I wonder if it makes me think how should one store calendar information and contact information because I'm basically porting my life over from Apple to my own system here. So that's that.

 The reason that I don't want to just make the app for another person now is because it's about scale. For one, the app is really made for me and anytime tuning it to someone else's brain has to be really justified why it will help me. You may say, well, it will help you by me paying you, but the issue is that's not a scalable strategy for me. If I make it for you, let's say it takes me 50 hours. That 50 hours might be really helpful and it might let you pay me a little bit of money. Now let's say you show it to someone else and it takes me 50 hours to make it for them. Let's say I was getting paid $20 an hour. $50 means that's $1,000 of effort. So I'll probably be doing $1,000 of effort for someone to give me what? Like $100. And unless they paid me like $50 every month, it wouldn't really be a scalable strategy. For me, what would be nicer is instead of making you the whole app would be to find what piece of functionality, just what's one piece about it, that you can use and doesn't have to be personalized but is useful to you. So I've been trying to think about what piece of what I'm doing is the most easy to give to other people. The part that I use the most, the thing that transcribes for me, is the least sellable part because it's already done. And it's not just already done, it's that what the real benefit is, it's going to be in is what it tells you. And so I'm trying to think about how can I simplify what I've made for myself to be something I can just put on a website. Because guess what? I don't want to have to make a whole app or now I have to worry about storing everyone's general entries. I don't want to be storing people's private information because then I got to learn how to make it so other people don't steal that. Because that'll be like saying I have a bunch of diamonds in my house, please no one rob me because I just really want people's diamonds. I don't actually want to steal them. I'm going to get robbed. So if I start saving everyone's personal journal entries, I'm making myself a target, right? I don't want to do that. So I would want to make something that I actually don't save anyone's data at all, where maybe you yeah, and it's a one time thing. You get your to do list, but I'm not going to save, which means that it's less valuable, but it's still valuable enough. Hopefully that someone would use it every now and then. If someone visits it maybe four times a week, I'd be happy. And I can offer different subscription models. But to me, the hard part is if I give something to someone else, it has to be something which doesn't... It doesn't... any amount of work I do needs to be on giving back to me directly. So if I'm building an app, it has to be something that I can give to a lot of people right away. I don't want to make something that every time a new customer happens, I have to do 50 more hours of work. It should be the amount of work I spend shouldn't scale a huge amount with the number of customers. So if you have any ideas.

 So, the thing I'm thinking about now is the issue of when you make something and I think there's so many apps out there ready, not even just with respect to what I want to do but just in general. There's probably so many, like whatever thing in your life that you want to speed up, you could probably spend some time learning an app that would solve that problem, whether it's a database or a thing that keeps track of appointment, so whatever. But my issue is I don't want to spend time learning someone's app because I realize when it comes to making my life better. Imagine I learn someone else's way of doing things. Okay, I learned it's helping my life and actually now that I've learned it so well, it makes my life easier than it is. Okay, what happens if that person can't make their app better anymore because they've moved on to other things? I'm left in the dark. So now you need to rely on supporting that person to continue making your thing. Let's not even talk about apps. Let's talk about clothing store or something. Let's say I have someone or what something you use every day, if not a... I don't know, let's say the water bottles. You rely on someone to give you a water bottle and it's the best water ever. No, I don't even know what the alternative is. But let's do this. So I'm saying the thing that I'm trying to do is I don't want to learn anyone's else's brain. And there's so many journaling apps out there that have all the features and what they seem to do is they say, here's something that is so amazing that if you know how to use it, you can make anything you want. And I'm like, wow, that's so cool. But I'm like, why would I do that? Because to me, there's levels of ability. So people who want to learn an app, to me are people who... It's easier to learn that app than to make it yourself because an app is built using code and code is built using logic. And if you can't understand code and you can't understand logic, you should spend your time learning the thing that the code makes. So let's say there's like a really good journaling app. Go learn all of the intricacies of the journaling app and then that way you don't have to learn how to code because all of the logic and that if I want every time I want an entry, I want it to be sent here and then I want those entries to be emailed out in my newsletter. You can find apps that do all that without you having to write a single line of code. The issue is for me, I feel like I can code. I feel like I can do math, I feel like I can do logic. So why not just get into the things myself because at the end of the day, if something isn't the way I want, I want to be able to tweak it. And so the problem is, I've gotten to the point where this thing, the problem it's supposed to solve is so specific to me that I need to make it from scratch because I want every little letter that's in the thing to be the way I want it. I want it has to be a custom mode of my brain. Now why am I saying that? I'm saying that to say my initial thought was like, oh, let me build this to do thing. But then I'm like, why am I thinking in terms of feature first? Let me make a feature. I should be thinking in terms of like, I've just made this very basic thing. I've actually not invented anything new. I've just glued a bunch of things that exist in a way that it's mine. And that's how I'm using it. So I'm talking to my phone and I'm uploading. And then it's saving all my entries. And to me, that's the coolest thing in the world because I've already solved my initial problem of, I'm not recording my thoughts. I've already started recording all my thoughts and they're in this perfect place. So now my thing is, I've solved that problem. I've solved the recording thoughts problem. Boom. I solved my problem way too quickly. And then I'm beginning to realize that wasn't that problem. There was millions of solutions to it. There was Apple telling me to use their notes at Google telling me to use Google docs, obsidian, pen and paper, people telling me, selling me journals. There's millions, but the thing that was throwing me off is that a journal is supposed to be personal. You're not supposed to rent a cubicle journal space. You're not supposed to go and do your journal and someone else's plot of land. So it's forced me to have a personal attachment to the thing I've made because I speak. It does the transcription. It's not probably whatever. And it gets sent to my computer, which is stored on my computer. And I want to do something where I'm going to build a little device that it gets stored on that little device. Then that device, the open device is just the store on my thoughts. Because what I'm, how's really thinking? Let me put it down for you. I'll put it down for you. Let me...

 I mean on the topic of seduce I have a lot of seduce. I gotta do the financial aid stuff. I don't know. I wanna make another work on this app tomorrow and make another app. Just something, some website that people actually navigate to. I saw this cool thing about how this guy was scraping Reddit to do market research on what apps to make. It's one way to do it. But I do like scraping and I like scraping data and it makes me realize I'm harvesting all my thoughts. There's a lot of harvesting of other people's thoughts to be done as well. I know in my last projects I used Chertchipitito. Scrape ideas from Ask Science. There are two folks about making posts about people, like post science posts, like YouTube shorts. But I'm sure I could scrape Reddit on app ideas or problems. But I don't really want to do that. I think Reddit has useful information. That's what the point of Reddit is to answer questions. I do product reviews find the cheapest item. That type of stuff. I don't really use Reddit to find ideas. Because once you're bullshit on there. If I were to just Reddit for Reddit, it would be like to make a top 10 list for cheap products. But yeah, well, when you built, Rome wasn't built in a day, so I should just be happy about my winning today.

 There's now with this app I've even made more feedback loops which I'm beginning to see are very important for making something you want to use which is a feedback loop is something is going back in. So here I've started by journaling and that text data becomes input into the journal which is now generating ideas and I've now made another feedback loop when I'm supposed to write these ideas and you see I'm now feeding back into using the app again but what that's making me think is the real benefit of this is to generate more high quality ideas and get more decisions out of that and what's amazing to me is the app is almost building itself because I'm talking to my app and by using my app I get more ideas of how would I change this all would I do with this but the app is being made way too quickly because now there's so much code that I have to now I've gotten to a place where now it's beginning to think hmm I wish I knew more about large language models hmm and it's beginning to feed itself in terms of what should I do next what should I learn but it's getting overwhelming I've made so much

 Notice there's a general thing as I'm watching a chat GPT turn my spoken word into code, you know, in the way that you know, Abercadabra, you know, I speak and then it comes into existence. I'm thinking that does have to be a place where I do write code myself so I can learn things. I really want to learn JavaScript just because I feel like that's the language of frontend experience and I'm going to need to know that in order to, you know, make the apps I want. So somewhere in there, I'm going to ask chat GPT. I'm going to choose a page that I want to design and I'm going to use that page as a chance to learn JavaScript. And yeah, so I'm going to use that as a chance to learn JavaScript. But I need to figure out a page to learn that. I mean, the annoying thing is about learning coding languages. It's like, I don't care about logic and blah, blah, blah. That's shit you can learn. You pick up along the way. I just want to know how to turn my problems and my solutions into that language. I think I could do that Python, but that's kind of like a pseudo code thing. So just kind of my thoughts on AR right now is I'm building, I'm creating. And I am learning something, but I'm not learning how to code. That's for sure. At least not in the details. But I'm learning how to build apps, I would say.

 I want to make another note. I was thinking maybe it would be cool to... You know, for... I want to make a blog post or some kind of content. I begin yapping. I get a good yapping. Then I have... The open AI API come and ask me questions to further develop my app to give you more details for whatever task I wanted to do. I need a way to turn my app into a prompt to get my tasks. Which is ask me questions live feedback loop of boom of your app transcribed. Okay, it asks me a set of questions. I think about them. I answer the questions in another set of apps. It adds those responses to a further info file. It listens to those. Basically, fully flesh out an idea via conversation with an AI and sharing those ideas. I think that would be a great idea. Instead of having a conversation with an AI, it's really like an AI. I ask me questions which I thought fully answered until I make even more high quality ideas.

 I'm also realizing that because this content is personal to me, I actually care. If chat GPT represents it poorly, so I end up just probably writing it myself. But now I'm understanding, oh this is why I was supposed to pay attention in English class. So I've got my argument, I think that's good. I need to know, the problem is now other readings, resources, what have other people said about this. And I have been trained, I've decided not to do this because I usually just like learning things but now I have to go read other people's opinions. That's the most boring thing to me. I don't really, is there already giving me sources and I'm like, but these are all suck. And if they're from the internet, how do I know they're not worse writers than me? I need to know who are the people, it's not just what has the top search result written about this. What has the most useful, meaningful person there has to say about this said, but that person might be not popular, oh, which is revealing to me that these search engines are not going to be useful for innovation unless we can get more personalized search engines, which means that I think that's exactly what I'm trying to design is a personal search engine. Because I don't care who's the most popular, the most SEO optimized result, I care what's the result most relevant and beneficial to me. And I wonder what search engines there are like that instead of just competing for attention and competing for who's going to help you spend the most time on your site. Google doesn't actually provide me the most relevant information anymore. And I feel like prompting an LLM to get what you want is similar to learning how to make the correct Google search. Because if you do the wrong Google search, you're just going to get a bunch of crappy websites now that just have ads on them. But if you do the right Google search and you basically the reason I do nonfiction research is because it gives me PDFs and things that are kind of hard to parse. So bots haven't taken over them or lecture slides or textbooks, peer reviewed articles. I need to know like what peer reviewed stuff. So now this leads to another thing, peer review, peer review and content creation. I think peer review would be more useful than just doing engagement. So if there is a platform where it was peer reviewed YouTube. So content creators of that niche like people who I don't know get voted somehow to abort or something, they go watch like people's videos and they okay, but then now we're getting into the trouble of censorship. But I think I'm not saying you shouldn't be allowed to post a YouTube. I'm saying, why what about what gets recommended? And this question about is my recommendation algorithm really what's best for me? Is it really giving me what I'm most interested in? People tell me that. But a lot of time my stuff on Instagram is the most brain dead stuff. If I can't watch educational content on YouTube, I think my brain is designed to just consume stupid stuff. My brain isn't designed to to the queue. YouTube shorts have no continuity. It's not even that they're too short. It's just in the span of 10 minutes, you have like unrelated content or if it is related, it's related on stuff that can be related without the individual accounts knowing about each other. It's just memes. So memes or this might now be saying, even if you curate your feed, there is no continuity. Which is what's hard from saying paying attention is I can not really continuously learn on something. But it's not like I'm becoming stupid. I think my brain is just changing or is being tuned differently. I like the word tune. And I don't know what to do with that thought, but I think it's another interesting idea. Yeah, I think. I mean, this is back to I'm actually anti technology in many ways because I feel like it's not here to help me, even though if I just buy the tech myself, it'll help me. But if I use other people's apps, then I'm just going to be taking advantage of it. Like I feel like we're forced to use phones now. I don't know like isn't it crazy that you're born and you're almost forced to use a Google product or an Apple product or a Microsoft product and you're forced to make the way you think around their design decisions. I feel like there should be like something like Linux is nice because you can make a personalized machine. It's a lot of work, but if everyone invested the work into learning computers that way, then maybe everyone would know like children learn so quickly. But by giving children the simple to use simplified graphical interfaces because we think they're stupid, we're actually limiting how much they can learn about computers. Children are very advanced. The more complicated the phone is, the more they'll be able to learn from it. But instead we've immediately simplified everything for children because we see them as incompetent or stupid. When if I could learn like a child right now, I think I'd be the smartest person in the room. So I mean that's another thing is I feel forced to simplify all of my designs so that you don't have to do work to see the content. But what if I made you work in a way that rewarded you? But it's really hard to do that because at a certain age people actually don't want to learn and they don't want to think and they don't want to be quiz. They have a lot of trauma about it, but I don't know.

 So if I didn't have computers or any of that stuff, I'd have to go through my whole mountain of organic thoughts and then begin to process it, clean it up. And one of the ways I might do that is I might try and think, can I first break up thoughts into bins which I can put them in? Because right now the only organization I have is the time and the date, right, without any intelligent computing and stuff. But the date and the time might not be the best way to organize my thoughts because right now they're in a line, right, the passage of time. What I might want to actually say is, hey, all of the thoughts about business or all of the thoughts about how I work as a person or all of the thoughts about math, I don't really want to have the thoughts about math in the same place is about the thoughts about business. Maybe if I just filter out all the thoughts about math, it'll be more useful, even more clear, there'll be less noise because my mathematical thoughts, my classes, my business ideas, I may say something like I really want to learn probability and then I might say something like I really want at $10,000 and then if you read those things at the same time you may have the false impressions that I want to learn probability and then make $10,000. That's not accurate. Those are two separate thoughts. The thing about organic thoughts is they don't have to be consistent, right? And you don't want all of your thoughts to combine into a megathop. So the first thing you might want to do is break them up into categories. Now if you think about that, that's actually a very intelligent task to do. Computers might be able to do it but you have to know some key information, what categories, right? What, what, what is the point of a category? Are you just breaking them up to make it easier to read or you breaking them up in order to extract more meaning? Okay now say you've put them into bins. Now instead of having one mound of organic thought you have 10 smaller mounds. So the amount of work is a little bit easier but you now have this question of what do I want to turn each of these mounds into? And I thought that one of the first things I need to be able to do in any kind of context is you need to be able to do citations and references. And I thought this interesting question, very simple question. How do I cite my thoughts? How do you cite your thoughts? Because the only way I have them stored is the time and date. So I could cite the tag that is saved in my database. But I think how you cite something reveals how well organized it is. Because I don't want to cite this as January 7th, 7.53 a.m. I want to cite this as on mathematical reasoning, right? Which means I want to now build my own internal database of documents. I want a reference, a textbook like an instruction manual for each one of my core thoughts. There's a few things that I've been saying which are guiding philosophies for everything else. One of the most useful things would be making some kind of reference. Not just for me, but it's easier to tell an AI, hey, go read my manifesto on how I think and then make the questions according to that. Versus, here's all of my raw thoughts make it useful. Versus, here's a very carefully crafted manifesto on what a useful thought is to me. Because you need to very carefully describe what it is you actually want. AI will not... AI doesn't quite solve the problem yet of what the hell are you talking about. All right, that's a problem that humans have. As humans can say something like, I want a million dollars. Well, you could just give them a million dollars. Does that solve the issue they're talking about? Yeah, if I tell you I want a million dollars and you're in a position where you say, great, here's a million dollars, I would tell you, well, I'm going to put this in my back pocket, maybe I'll buy a cheeseburger, but like, I don't know what to do with the other $960,000. What I was really trying to say is, I want a way to make a lot of money or I want a way to not worry about bills. There's so many other things one could meet. And AI, I don't think we've made models or that's very possible that interpret what you're saying perfectly. And I think people are working on this. But what I think is interesting is by positioning myself as someone who thinks a lot about the way I think and the way I interpret people, I'm almost in this position of thinking, how could I help a computer think like me in order to help me? Because I think there's a huge amount of value to have a computer model that instead of saying what something a scholar would probably say, I really want what something Eric would probably say. Because if I could do that, I could have clones of myself. Because do you know the way the general way that these AI's work is, let's say something as simple as a coin, right? Let's say I flip a coin a thousand times and you write down heads, tails, heads, tails, tails, heads. And let's say from that information, I was able to learn that it's a 50, 50 chance, it's heads and it's a 50, 50 chance, or 50 chance it's tails. Now let's say I had a machine which could simulate probabilities. Now I don't need the coin. I just plug into the machine 50% chance of this 50% chance that, and now I've simulated the coin. I'm able to generate what the coin would do. Now if you abstracted a little bit and you think of something like a picture, a picture can be broken down into, let's say, pixels or a little chunks of that picture. And you could guess what's the probability that this chunk is red and what's the probability this chunk is blue? And let's say you studied a bunch of paintings and you learned those probabilities, you could now just randomly pick a color based on these probabilities learned and you would get a picture which seems to probably be a type of picture that would come. And that's what it means to generate something. You're learning what would a human probably do and then you just, you sample that. Now I'm interested in what would I probably do, but the problem is I need to, I can't just train on all of my unstructured raw thoughts because if I train on my unstructured raw thoughts, what am I going to clone? I'm going to clone the version of me that just talks a lot. What I really want to clone is the version of me that works that is able to go from idea to impacting life change in a day. The version of me that understands perfectly what's the next steps to get closer to my goals. But in order to clone that version of me, I first have to make it for myself and then understand that blueprint, which is what I'm saying. I think even now I'm phrasing it as a general app, I'm doing a very deep dive into how I think and how I operate.

 My brain is buzzing and I cannot contain it because like I'm saying I know at my greatest potential when I don't have to worry about pleasing other people or being a human and when I have every resource at my fingertips what I can do is limitless. There's really nothing I feel like there's no challenge that any other human has that I feel like I couldn't contribute to. Every problem that a human faces they face me too. They're immediately relevant to me. By being selfish about my life I'm actually being very caring about everyone else's because how am I supposed to help you if I can't even help myself? I may be able to give you care or comfort or speak to you but I will not actually be able to solve your problem because I don't even know how to solve it for me and something there's some very key problems that I would like to solve for myself if for no other reason other than to help other people solve them because I have a really big problem which is I love mathematics. It's my passion and sadly I found it a great struggle to enjoy the institution of school and mathematics and I've also found it very hard to continue learning mathematics because the amount it demands from you basically asks you to sacrifice the other parts of your life and your other interests and I'm really wondering can I fight for that and that's one thing I'm trying to do here is how can I continue learning at the rate I would have been at I've been in school and beginning to realize that oh there's a serious possibility that now that I've removed school I might even learn more and better and happier and the thing though is in order to do that you have to make products that other people will look at not buy but look at and be impressed you have to and the product could be a research paper it could be a blog it could be showcasing what I'm doing I just have to do something that lets people know I am doing something great and not to flex or boost my ego but so that people will finally try and help because I'm trying to say if you help me I'll help you and I think I'm getting very annoyed at how powerless one individual is because even these big companies like I'm thinking the CEOs of Apple and Google let's not lie and say that they're the researchers they are running businesses and they are there to make sure that no one steals their spot and you even though I'm so thankful that they've made a lot of the technologies open and available to use there's something sinister which happens which is people make wonderful technologies using their tech and then guess what they just buy you so if you do do something brilliant and interesting some big companies is gonna buy you and the hardest part be hardest part to me about this process so far is even getting it started so if someone can buy the cost of getting started they will every time imagine if someone said hey Eric I have already working business I've already gotten to the position where I don't really need to run it but I don't really want to run it I'll give it to you for $50,000 let's say I had $50,000 I would seriously consider buying a reoccurring paycheck or a business that's already established for it's cheap right and I'm saying this to say even if one makes something great it does not solve like the further you get the competition gets more extreme because I could not survive competing against Apple, Google, whatever as an individual you have to grow to their scale or their skill level to compete with them and that means that anything I make now I'm relying on the brainchild of my brain is enough to compete with people that work alone which is really hard because people work alone not just compete with other learners but with people with teams but I'm saying that from a creativity standpoint I bet on myself in terms of a lot of the other stuff I don't know a lot I don't know a lot about computers compared to how much I want to know I don't know a lot about making YouTube accounts and stuff I think I know enough to get started but I feel like I just don't know and that worries me and it scares me but I want to focus on that's why I just want to focus on what can I do next instead of what don't I know what don't I get what am I unable to do

 Another error I just noticed is you can spam hit the summarize button and you should only be able to compute that once. So in general I want to figure out a workflow that anytime something gets computed if it's computed and displayed don't allow them to compute it again or me otherwise we're just gonna waste resources but yeah that's an error handling to do.

 So, let's forget AI, computers, technology, all of that. We're living in Newton's times. And what I have is basically say I'm a crazy person and I've just written down all of my words on some pieces of paper or whatever you write on. And I have maybe, you know, like a hundred pages. I've just me just saying anything. And I give that to you. And if you don't care about me a whole bunch, it's useless. You probably won't read through it. And if you do read through it, I have to be incredibly amusing on the first page for you to want more or you have to be incredibly curious. But either way, there's a lot of work for the reader to do to extract value out of it. And the main value is probably an entertainment, right? But what I'm trying to say is, now, what are the other ways humans have tried to make written words valuable? Well, people could do an edit or something and maybe read make like a book. But there's a few steps in between a book, but let's say like an article first. So I take some piece, let's say in all of this blah, blah, blah, you know, maybe on the 10th page, there's this bit of wisdom and on the 70th page. There's maybe like five things that I pick out. And I say, you know, these are worthwhile picking these seeds out, planting them in this article, kind of guiding how they grow and giving something a little bit more structure. Because this article which I've now pruned a little bit, taking the good parts, I can give to someone and there's a lot less work to be done to extract value out of it. Okay, and then you might write like 20 articles that you've picked out of this blob. This is just massive organic matter. I've now written 20 structured articles and I say, you know, these articles with a little bit of fine tuning could come together into something larger than an article, maybe a small book. And now, but I'm saying there's this process of all these different types of text are just refining this big blob because everything usually starts in this organic mess, maybe a conversation or maybe teachers. And here the only reason you write a book is math books always start from being lecture notes. Maybe you taught a class and you be in to see a lot of common things that students have questions about. And then by the time you finish election or to realize there's no book that does this. So then you just do the extra work of making a book. And what I'm thinking is that I was hoping that this big blob by using these now, let's remember AI exist and stuff. I was hoping this big blob is something that AI could now process into those valuable pieces. But there's a few roadblocks to that. One, it's not at the point where the technology that's available to me, I plug it in and it just works. I believe it's possible, but there's a lot of extra work to be done to get there and a lot of companies, big companies are doing that work. But one thing that's very interesting to me is it's something where I feel competitive in because it's not a matter of how big is your computer. It's not a matter of how many smart minds do you have work and me kind of is, but really what I'm thinking is in order to take this big blob of my own personal organic data, turn it into something relevant. I want have to understand deeply what's in that blob and understand deeply what do I want out of that blob. And those are very hard questions because for any little piece of information that I've said in the past one week, if you nitpicked it, I have to be able to generate a whole more information from it, which requires you to be a lot of thinker or talker. And secondly, if you think of something as simple as an essay, we can grade people based on how well good their writing is. And what I mean by that is how well does it represent what I said for one and two, how much value would it provide to someone who's not me? And the way that I assess that value is based on is the information novel. Does the information give you a different way to view things or approach things? Are the challenges addressed or the concerns addressed? Is there a structured plan? Like just how well thought out is your actual argument? Because on the scale of you just send this and you put it into an essay to why you really thought about this. You want to be on the you really thought about this. And there's different the whole point of English classes and all that is to learn how to do that. The other thing is us thinking about how's generating these business ideas. And I realize I don't like that. What I want to be generating is interesting problems and interesting questions. Because I thought a really good question, the business will make itself. Because if I have a problem that I'm in love with, but I've chosen it to be relevant, then I just have to solve the problem. And in the process of solving the problem, I'll make the cool things. But if you tell me make an app that does this, there's no room for creativity now immediately for me. Because if there is room for creativity, I'll probably end up making something that's not the thing. But if I just seek to set out to answer this question, a lot of times the solution is something you couldn't even predict. So I said let me try and generate a problem. But then that requires you to understand deeply what's a good question. And I think scientists are actually in a good position to answer that question. Because think about where's the place that I've spent the past few years trying to learn what's a good question. You got to ask so they're trying to teach all these high school students what's a good research question. How do you formulate a hypothesis? And I'm blah, blah, blah. And you've seen how much pain I've had to turn my math into, oh you have to get a hypothesis. But really what I think they should be saying is what problem are you trying to solve or address. And without even knowing how amazing the project is, you can immediately know how good the project is by how good the problem is. The research statement, the goal. And so I'm trying to, I'm familiarly said, hey, well since France is baking and all that stuff, people have tried to understand the scientific method and good research. This is great. But I have to now figure out a way to give an anatomy and give a structure to all these things in a way that I can turn into computer program and get back what I want. But that's forcing me to really understand what is the anatomy of a question. Because these things will give you what you want. So if I say give me a question, it'll give me any question. If I say give me a question relevant to me, it'll give me a question that kind of sounds like me. But that's not what we want. We want a question that it's scope is not too broad. It's falsifiable meaning it shouldn't be like this God exists. A type of question like that, I might be able to introduce a bunch of interesting things but I won't be able to come up with an answer. There should be like it's there's a whole bunch of things. I don't want again to but understanding what a good question is I think is possible. And so just what I'm trying to say is I have this ever growing mountain or just pile of organic thoughts and I'm growing it every single day. Because my no my brain can do that and really should think of this as a small smidgen of what I've generated in my whole life. And what I'm trying to say is I have this ability to just generate more and more organic thoughts. Can I turn it into diamonds? Can I turn it into a house? Can I turn it into a hundred dollars a week? That's really my question is how valuable? I want to be clear that the AIs are necessary because the problem is I have this.

 So I just woke up. This is the first time I'm trying. I didn't just wake up. I probably woke up maybe like 30 minutes ago. I've just been lying in bed thinking things through. This is the first time I'm kind of using this as a morning device. And I guess the point is I'm just supposed to talk out loud, which is what I'm going to do. I feel a little bit off because I'm really hungry. I didn't really eat that much yesterday. There's enough food downstairs where I could figure something out. But I'm quite picky and all I want to do is work on this app. And I know I have enough in me to work on the app without eating, but I know I should probably eat. I don't know what to do about that. I didn't immediately use this app because I was sleeping with my son. I didn't want to wake her up by talking into my phone. But I moved rooms. I checked my phone. Caltech is apparently going through some crazy high wind and there's fire around. So I'm being told to evacuate. Yesterday I submitted my petition to be reinstated because my math 130 was created a day late. It's my fault. Not theirs. I did pass the class. That's all I'm happy about. Then I got the person who said I have bills to pay and I haven't done my financial aid. So I'm doing no financial aid. So it's unlikely I'll be able to pay all those bills. So those are all stressors on my brain. But they're not what I really want to work on. But there's no saving. There's no angel to come down and help me. But I really don't want to think about those things. I want to do exactly enough of those things so that it doesn't scream you over later. But I want to start my day by working on this. I really don't know what to do next with this app. Because you know kind of related to the things I was saying yesterday. I don't want to be a feature first person. I don't want to just go and be like what's the newest feature I can do. Because I only want features that I will use every single time I hit record. I don't want to make more features that just don't get used but could make my life better. Because there's already apps out there that could make my life better but I don't use them for a reason. I want every single feature to be used. Not just I'm forced to use it but I have to use it. And I don't really know what to do. I mean that would probably be processing of the data. But I mean the next thing is I'm going to have spoken my mind. And I would like the app to tell me what to do next. I haven't really been checking how accurate the transcription is. I hope it's accurate enough that it gets the general idea. I'm also realizing I need to catch whatever large language model I'm using up on the context. And they're good but they're not good enough to generate ideas on their own. I really want to just make sure it's organizing my ideas. I don't want it to contribute its own ideas because in this little capability is possible. I want the general to be me talking to myself. I don't want it to be me talking to a large language model. And I just want to make sure my effort is spent. Well like if I work on front end, I'm going to have to do a lot of learning about front end. That's going to be annoying. Also the code base scares me that I've written so far because I don't know what files are linked to what other files and reflect. It's going to be a pain in the ass for that reason. I'm going to might be a good idea to just go through and to take everything, make a big abstract sketch of what's going on. But I really don't know why but I really want to do something new and cool for this. But I mean it does. It's more about me than the app. It's more than I'm doing things than the fact that the app exists. And this is another key point I want to emphasize. I want to make apps that encourage people to change their behavior, encourage me to change my behavior. And the behavior I'm changing is I didn't use to talk to my phone in the morning. Now I'm doing that. I'm doing that with the potential that it'll be useful to me later. But just storing that data, storing those ideas is hopefully the good thing, the important thing. Maybe I need to be getting feedback if these ideas are useful or what should I be thinking about. I mean I don't know. As far as fun things, you know, I should probably go to a bookstore just for fun. I walk around. It is extremely cold. So I don't know how feasible that'll be. I probably should go make food. I'm probably going to do that next. But that's where I'm at with things.

 For me the important part isn't so much what am I accomplished where am I at now can I rest. It's more the one thing that I don't want to lose is my childish creativity and there's certain skills that I feel like I'm fighting against time and life to keep because it's so easy to let go of the the mindset that you could change things not just the world but your own life because I think is you start to observe how the world works the longer you observe that and the more you try and fight against it you may get put into submission it may become the case that you like what seems to be your friends commenter like I thought you know I there's some people who said that they exactly what you just said Eric and you know what they really regret having that and that's very valid but I wanted to somehow like in this I think another aspect that play here is there's all these different people who are expressing uncertainty if you can be someone in this world for everyone's expressing uncertainty if you can be someone who has an idea or a vision or a plan or a way to organize these people they will naturally come and help you and I think that's how I was looking at and I spent the first few the first week looking at Steve Jobs what I noticed is Steve Jobs wasn't the smart guy he wasn't the guy with the traditional path he wasn't the guy who could you know get rid of everybody's concerns here's just the guy who was happy telling people what to do and he he had this eternal confidence that what he told people what to do what should be the thing that's done you see what I'm trying to say and so he became someone that all of these smart people felt happy aligning themselves with you know and I'm saying that what I'm also trying to do is make sure the way I speak the thoughts I have are relatable enough but also at the end of the day I'm not interested in saying hey here's how life feels let me heal that I'm interested in only what can I do what can I do and I think when Elsa tells me you know about therapy or if you tell me about Dr. Franco I think of these things as incredibly valuable and they're useful for everyone I don't want to say I'm saying that but I want to say my main priority above all else is how do I how do I get closer to my goals and I've almost been if there's one thing that I almost feel absolutely sure about it's that if you want to climb huge mountains accomplish things that should not be accomplished you need to almost be obsessive about accomplishing those things and obsessive means consistent but it also means you don't even have the ability to stop wanting to do it you know what I mean like it's not a matter of discipline to me I don't work well with discipline because discipline implies that you're doing something you don't want to do I'm asking the question how do I want to do it because soon as soon as I want to do it

 One thing I was thinking about last night is I want to start making like little YouTube videos. I want to make a video where I basically rant about how fucking stupid this process is. And I think maybe it'll be cool to start with some shorts. I just want to turn my thoughts into different YouTube shorts. One of those shorts I want to be like, you know, why it sucks to be in this position of trying to make apps and being on-trip the newer and all of that stuff. And I have to think a little bit about why should someone watch that. I mean, the reason why I so much you watch that is because it's fucking relatable and it makes me feel better. So I just want to make a real that's like, you know, I'm been trying to do this and it sucks. But if you're trying to do it too, you know, don't worry about it. I want to make like a community of people build a brand. But I don't know what the background should be for such a video. I mean, I could just talk at the camera, but I don't really have a studio or something. I'd like to do it all. Something would be fun, but then that's a lot of work. But you know, I think it reflects my style and you know, why not? So I'm like, taking, you know, let me just fucking make a video about how shitty this is on a new YouTube channel. I don't know what's like, I don't really know what catch is my attention when I'm scrolling through. I think maybe some like mathematics would be cool because I like math. Math catch is my attention or showing off some cool animation or something. I could just screen myself, screen record myself using someone's cool app animation thing. I think a cool video idea would be like, are you trying to make an app and you don't know where to start me too? If you tried looking up tutorials and everyone tries to sell you a course, me too. Does this process fucking suck? Yes, it does. Yeah, I'm not here to like tell you how to get better anything. I'm just here to say I'm doing it too. It sucks. But you know, you got that. Just keep trying every day. I'm trying my stuff. I'm working on my Apple make a video, hopefully trying to break down all of the small things that I've learned to help people out. Also, you know, my problem with AI and stuff. There's more tools than ever, but you really do have to just think about what problems and all of that. I don't know. I have a pipeline that like makes a YouTube video just based off these thoughts. I think that'd be really great to have real. The only problem is the background content. I don't really know what I should do for that. Like I bet it's vlog probably be the easiest thing. Be yeah. I feel like vlogging is more of like Instagram breals format. Like talking to have a vlogging. I mean Instagram breals is super competitive space in terms of how quality of the reals and the recommendation algorithm. But YouTube is a little bit better at cutting long. You could just be a little bit more. I mean, I don't know. I just want to upload the real and fucking. Yeah. I don't know. I say things I probably storyboards break it down into a problem. Okay, that's enough to motivate me. The eat.

 I want to talk a little bit longer just to get more ideas. I wanted to show Dr. Carl Spite the idea so far because I thought it was interesting and I thought he might find it interesting. But I know he wouldn't really understand exactly what I want to do and less side. Kind of flesh out my ideas here and I think the part you would find interesting is the ways in which I think about organizing my ideas and doing analysis on them, which is the part that I kind of want to go off and do now. I think it would be fun. I think it's just annoying because I wish I could do these brainstorms into this journal. But it's really hard for me to think of how to make graphical information able to be spoken. But I think I can journal, draw the pictures, probably scan them. I don't know how to best save them. I don't know how to make my drawings in notebook sketches computational. I think that's something that's a big question I should think about. If I draw something, how do I process that drawing into computational information that a computer can work with? And that's because I'm representing abstract ideas. And can any model or can I process these charts or drawings into something that a large language model can work with and understand? Apparently Lama parser is good at that. I'll try that. The other thing is scanning my journal is going to kind of suck because it's going to be time consuming. It'd be cool to have a device that automatically scans journals. And I'll look into how you see that is to make. I don't want to do any robotics, which is why I imagine it's annoying because the hard part will be the flipping the pages part. I'm sure there's many excellent solutions that have been designed for this in particular. Then what else? Yes, I think what I'm going to do now is go and work in my, in a journal that I find trying to really understand how to structure the data analysis and the ideas.

 So what I want to say is that the beauty of this app, the real significant part isn't that it can listen to you and get the audio. The beauty, which is what I've started to work on, is that it's going to be able to give you insights into what you just said. So maybe, you know, I found having a conversation partner is great because they can tell you what the value and what you just said is and give you real-time feedback. To me, that's what my issue with a journal has always been is the journal doesn't give you feedback. It's always just been a place to store things. But I have had a terrible time with storing things. My room, it gets messy, it gets cluttered. Because the more stuff I have, the less obvious it is on what to focus on. So I want a journal that's intelligent in giving me exactly what I should focus on based on what I put in. So, my...

 Okay, I'm having a crazy Jimmy Neutron Brain blast. There's a few things to note. I've got the Chachi Reti reading all my journal entries and giving me actionable steps, they're pretty great. But one noticeable interesting thing is that all of the 99% of the ideas it generates says it'll make no money in the next year. One of them said it would make money and that is monetizing this app. Which honestly seems legit. But I realized I need to be doing two things. One, engineering the prompt is going to be of utmost importance. This structured data thing is so amazing. It allows me to get a data exactly how I want it. This is perfect. The other thing is I need to not feed too much into Chachi Reti. First, I want to feed all of my journal entries and then I want it to filter out only the most important ideas and thoughts for making money. And be generous. Have an open mind. Don't just take traditional wisdom. Choose the ideas that you think are most likely to help me make money based on my personality and my skills. And that should be enough. You want to pick the amount of words that a large language model would be able to give specific actionable advice. But few enough words to avoid overfitting. So first I need to make another prompt that filters down into the great ideas and kind of makes my thoughts cohesive. So help me write that prompt.

 I want to make, I think a good blog post would be, how did I get this AI to say something useful? Because one of the hardest problems I ever got was, how do you make a large language model, actually tell you something specific? And I should make a blog post that details how to make this so far like a recipe, so I could even tell myself and post it on my own stuff. So, the great thing is because I'm saving all this information my journal, I'll have access to all of this, but anyway, let me talk to you instead of to the recorder.

 So I think I'm at the point where I want to start pivoting away from adding features to YAP Journal and instead make sure it's a working product for me to work on my second task, which I've decided will be working on my personal website. So I'm going to be creating a new tag, the personal website tag, that I'll be collecting all the information related to that now using YAP Journal. And I think as I begin to use the journal functionally rather than trying to build it, it'll be clear what to do next with it. So just to describe how I want my personal website to be first of all, I want it to be a hub for all of the information that I would like other people to know about me, as well as the people that I would like to be connected to me. I want to forget having a LinkedIn or an Instagram or any of that stuff and I really want my personal website to fulfill the need of all of those things. I don't really care about having a CV, although I can put in about me section where I include that information. I would like it to look interesting. I thought it could be cool to have the late tech type as one of the background things that could be fun, but it's not so relevant. But I think I should start simple with just a page that has some basic information about me and things like that. It's clickable. And then once I have that template, I think I can move towards beginning to learn some JavaScript stuff. I would like the project to be on node, so I can learn about node. JS. And I think I could probably get something up and running in two, three hours. So I need to also generate a kind of timeline for that. I'd had to best spend those few hours, but honestly, I think just getting started would be good and then having a few checkpoints. I think having some reasonable checkpoints as well as reasonable small problems to solve along the way would be really cool. So that's kind of what I want to be working on next.

So I looked at the ones and it said text editor things like that, holy crap, I didn't realize programming in C takes that much time to make such a simple application. So thinking can you then break it up into smaller sub problems that I can do and in the end I glue them together to be an interesting problem. Because the thing I'm worried about is that if I go too long without something to show for it it won't be worth it. I want the best kind of projects you know after an hour of work you have something cool to show for it. And I don't know how to achieve that in the C language other than first making the thing that's going to make me make more cool things and it's kind of weird to do that with C because I should really write something that's best written in C but I don't know what something I could build and see that I would use every day. I want to build a project that I'm going to immediately use in my workflow every day. And the best thing I can think with that is like on a rewriting some other person's program or like making something that may be searches through my files and does something cool like I don't know searches for all the files. I don't know you know I mean this stuff's all done to test so I'm not going to be able to make one better but I really want a project that I will immediately start using in my workflow.

 I realize one big thing that makes me me is my taste in sources. By that I mean which resources I find valuable, which ones I think are bullshit, which ones I think are just designed to capture my attention. I want to kind of invent a way to automatically assess if a online article is worth my time or not by evaluating it on a few key metrics. One, how technical is the document? I often find that the more technical the document, the less it's trying to just appeal to an audience to get them to try and stay on the website. Two, how valuable is the information that the article is sharing? By that I mean how relevant is it to my projects and how much of a key insight is it rather than just reposting someone else's ideas or well-known information? It actually leads me to the next point, how unique is the information? Is this something that is mentioned a lot in other articles or is there an original place I can find that this was mentioned? Another thing I look for is how personalized is the document. Does it have a lot of personality, unique personality that represents the author as well? Or is it just text that's in headers and bullet points and has no personality? The worst possible thing would be to use AI-generated content. The next thing I look for is what time and year was it made to know where it fits in that. Another important thing is how readily available is information about the author, including where they work, what's their education, what's their past projects. I would like to have something that automatically scrapes for really good blogs based on some of these metrics so I can be reading those. That's great.

 I'm realizing that the quality of the analysis I'll get from directly using large language models really depends on how well I can specify my prompt, how well I can use multi-step agent ways of using large language models. It depends on how well I tune the temperatures and different things that affect novelty. And the annoying part is because I don't understand that well what's going on, it takes me a while to write code to begin interacting and I want to say a key point here is that being able to interact with your own work, your own app, live in real time is what generates the most useful ideas. You need to be able to interact with what you're making. As long as it's behind a code editor or in a notebook or you're not making it, you're not going to be able to interact with it and every decision you make will be hypothetical. You want to be making real time decisions because that is the way that you use most of your brain power. With that being said, another issue I'm noticing is the real gems, the real diamonds of what I'm saying are hidden behind so much fluff and noise. I need to find a way to process my noisy journal data to the nuggets of wisdom. And I think that can be done without large language models by simply first compressing my journal. I have a lot of repeated ideas and repeated thoughts and I need to compress them so that each thought is represented once because I don't think I've come up with a thousand ideas but I think I've written enough words that if they were treated as unique it would be like a thousand ideas. So I think I need to find a good way to compress my journal down into a compressed set of points but each point should not be loss of information. I should faithfully, I just basically want to glue together the things that need to be glued together first and begin organizing my thoughts. I need to find a way to say that two journal entries are related and then when I do that I can just look at the connected components of the graph of my thoughts and those connected components can then be analyzed. I think that's the algorithmic way to do it and I'll approach it that way.

 So just an update me and GPT have been going back and forth on... well it's really just been doing what I tell it to do but I've added topic extraction with some custom topics that I got by giving all of the text so far to GPT and asking for a custom topic list. I don't know how good it is but we'll see. There's also keyword extraction. I think right now I'm doing all the keyword and all that stuff on command but it would be nice if I pre-computed that beforehand and I can do that maybe later. I updated the styling so it looks a little bit nicer and I think there's more to do with that later. Just something to note. For a recorded audio playback it doesn't actually work on mobile for some reason. Not that that's a really important feature but it's a feature that's there and doesn't work. I mean yeah at some point it's going to be actual data analysis on the text but the user experience is pretty great right now.

 I'm realizing the importance of open source in all of this. It's very important I've been using more open source technologies because it's not just because I'm, it's not because they're complicated or anything, but it's that I, at theoretically, have control over what my user experience is. When I own my information, no one is legally, no one is protected from not making my, like Apple and Google and there's so many things that they're protected from me getting my stuff for it's, it's not mine. I'm renting my, my own life. But open source, you know that the person is not just trying to make them buck off you. You know that they're just trying to make a useful tool or it might be their side project whatever. And I think about how useful version control is and contributing and I just wish intelligence and knowledge was like this, like there was GitHub for arguments so we could advocate for ourselves because a bunch of talented people should be working together on the side to help each other out. We shouldn't be isolated and I want to find out where do communities exist that I can get connected with people like me and if I can't, if I can't find those communities, how can I make them for myself? I mean that's probably what I'm going to do. I'm going to try and make an Instagram or something that like is a community of people that I need help from. But I need a way to engage them and that's I want to make like maybe a blog, a blog, a place where we can argue and all that stuff. So I'm going to do that.

 I don't need time to identify it. Anyway, so there's a bug. And you know, for a lot of this in order to develop very quickly, I've been using ChatGPT as basically a coding assistant. And one thing I was getting a little bit nervous about is that ChatGPT wrote much of the code so far. And the reason I was nervous is a few reasons. One, a kind of imposter syndrome that should not be writing every little bit of thing. And two, a concern that there'll be up once ChatGPT is not able to help anymore. I won't be able to make more of that. But there was also the issue of ChatGPT had written so much code so quickly that now there was so many files that it became hard to understand what was going on. Because I produced a bunch of stuff that I didn't even understand. So I basically wanted to solve an issue today that I had noted for a fixing later. And I got the head. Is it too hot for you? No, no, I thought you had forgotten about it. I'm doing this to just clean the plant. But ChatGPT, I decided to fix my issue without using ChatGPT. Because I decided if I can't fix this issue, then I don't even deserve to use ChatGPT. So I spent some time fixing it but it's a really small part. And I learned a lot from that process. Not just I learned a lot because the bug told me how the program worked. And also I learned a little bit about why fixing your own bugs makes your code better. And I think this reason I'm telling you this is because I think it applies to a lot of stuff in life too. So I had this bug which it didn't break the program but it gave me a feature that I didn't was unexpected. I didn't want. And the way I had written the code, the way I think of code is as instructions to the computer. So the way we were talking about before, that you might instruct someone to do something and they'll go and do something else. Because if I told you go left, go right and go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go When I ask you guys, you know what, when the quickest way to get the computer to tell me what. And I guess I'm talking to him like there's an analogy here to like when I'm with myra. And I want to get how her brain works, how someone's brain works, how an argument works, how anything works. Yes?

 So I just woke up. I'm continuing my habit of recording my voice first thing in the morning. I am trying to speak in a way that the transcription will do a very good job considering upgrading the model. But besides that, I really want to be able to speak quickly and make sure it transcribes everything. Also, I don't speak in a punctuated way and I need to be able to capture all of that period. I had a lot of thoughts about what to work on. I could refactor the code, you know, make it easy to develop. That would include making interfaces for the database in order to separate dependencies and all the parts that all the parts can be developed without worrying too much about what's connected to what. So I think a refactor is in order that makes each part less dependent on each other. But really the key part to do next is to start doing some kind of analysis or processing on the textual data that I've already collected. I think I need to do a really good job of asking what is it I actually want to understand from this data that I collected. What is it that I actually want to know? What's data that I would interact with? Because just as a reminder, the issue is with the journal, I don't read back. I don't look at that content. So what is the way I could process or transform my current textual data and there's something that I'd actually interact with? That's a question I don't really understand yet. I think I really need to sort of have a brain blast sit down and just write in a paper journal possibly get high and write in a paper journal. What is it I really want to understand? This is where it's going to become more like a research project to understand. What is it that I want to get out of my journal? What is the full extent to which I can turn this app as I call it into useful, actionable information, critical information? Perhaps I should not do coding today but I should do more of a pen paper research and take a step back from the technical and think more about bigger picture stuff because I think without direction it's hard to implement this feature because yes I could start playing with artificial intelligence features to summarize and make lists and all this stuff but I really am thinking that this wouldn't exactly be data that I would use. So I want to sort that out. There's a lot of deployment questions to be made but I think I'm in no rush to deploy this app. I am sort of in a rush to start working on other apps and I want to make sure that this helps me with that. I mean another course of action would be to start working on other ideas. I can have another brain best for ideas to work on. But for today I think I don't have any meetings to do other than with my mom and with my list at 8 a.m. apparently. I slept really well. I feel good. I've been getting pretty good sleep actually. We ate with Frank yesterday so I had a nice meal. I feel good. I feel rested. I feel energized and motivated but I do feel a little bit of a need to optimize my schedule for my physical health. I am a little bit stressed about the whole Caltech. An eligibility business I have to do the financial aid stuff still. Need to sit down and do that. Just a lot to be done and I want to figure out the workflow also to help this journal keep track of my tasks and to help me prioritize and spend a little time on the things I don't want to do and as much time on the things I do want to do. I'm making sure that the high urgency things do get completed. Again I want to be learning more stuff. There's a lot of different things to optimize and struggle here. Yeah, that's my update for this morning.

 I figured while I'm at it that I should change the tagging system to include more tags. There was an issue before because on the entries HTML, there's a line that got the tag, the text associated with the tag using if statements to detect each tag, but I realized the tag text was being passed with the tag so I can just do an abstract display this with the value associated the tag so I did that and add the meta observation tag. And I'm trying that out now, but I'm going to actually save this as Yaptab and then do a different one for the meta observation, but that's cool because I solved that problem.

 So, man, I am so annoyed because I called my friend to tell him we talked, but one thing that I told him is him, okay the matrix kind of opened up for me, in that once I started building my journal, I've started to use everything on the internet and begin to think, how hard would it be to do this myself? And it turns out I think a lot of applications I could make myself in a week, like something as simple as a notepad. A notepad doesn't make money, but it's an essential part of a computer, right? And I was like, well I could make my own notepad. I think I understand how to make applications a bit better now and I see it's possible. Would it be the best notepad? No, could I make my own and would it be useful to just say I have my own? Yes. Now, the... You can also choose the level at which you call it your own. What I mean by own is I own the intellectual property. And what I'm realizing is for a product that someone owns, they own that product, they own the idea and they own a lot of things, a lot of the time, right? But there's a level where if you break up the idea enough, it's made of pieces that no one owns. For example, logic, no one owns logic, but this is made of logic and the way in which you arrange that logic you can put ownership on, right? But if you take it down to the pieces that no one owns and rebuilds it yourself using the pieces no one owns, you can say you own your own notebook until you start selling it to people. Then people will claim actually know you I already own that idea. My point is I told my friend Disney said, well now that you see how easy it is to make apps, we can see why I've been obsessively trying to get... He said there might be people who do a pizza company and they know everything about pizza and they know nothing about websites and he's getting them to try and host their website through him. And I was thinking it's so hard for me to step out of my brain and think in terms of a human being that could not make their own website. And I'm going to go make my own website, but to me it makes zero sense how someone couldn't make their own website that does exactly what they want. But I'm beginning to remember, even if people are capable, who the hell wants to make a website? It's boring to most people. And so he's saying, well we can immediately be getting our first customers just by telling other people will do it for them. And I told him that's a great point except I hate that part. I want to do the making of the thing. I don't want to be going door to door trying to get other people to use the thing. Which what was annoying me was I was realizing I like doing, which makes me... you'd want me at a company. But the problem is I don't want a boss. So I'm like this super employee who doesn't want to be employed by anyone. And I'm think I was just getting really annoyed but I feel like all of the reasons you give someone a lot of money. I feel like I have those. Not because I'm trying to be arrogant, but because I feel like there's people who make $20,000 a year. And I'm beginning to remember it has nothing to do with how smart you are. It has to do with what jobs are available. And the thing that's making me really annoyed is if I wanted $10,000, the most absolutely certain way would probably be to try and pick up some kind of cashier job or something nearby. I'd probably or a barista or something. If it was really about money and we're trying to pick up jobs, but the thing that I'm trying to also implicitly do, and I realized I didn't specify this enough to my AI, was I do not want to be giving my time away for free. The reason I really like these projects is because I'm not making money right now, but I'm learning so much about the fact that I know I could make an app if I wanted to because I'm making my own. That knowledge that I could do that and saving it somewhere so I have it on a portfolio or something that is invaluable, right? Because later down the line I can tell someone, yeah, I made my own journaling app. I know a lot about how I, that's valuable. But if I say I worked for an hour doing this, I would learn a lot. I mean, a lot of people would learn about that specific industry, but that's not an industry I know how to reliably continue my goals with. So I'm trying to think about ideas not just that make money in the next month, but that make money in something I want to do and I learn a lot doing them because I want to be rewarding in every which way. And I historically have done things which are very intellectually rewarding, but not monetarily rewarding at all. I've had to rely on competitions and things like that to say I've made any money, but let me.

 Man, I'm just here. I hit the pendulum and crazy and I started feeling great, but I didn't do any work. And I just so been thinking, it's so annoying because I make such cool things. I should be so rewarded, I should be so happy about all the cool stuff I just did and all I can think about is that it hasn't made me any money. It's so cool. I'm doing shit, I wish I'd be able to know how to do this. This is the type of shit that I begs to be able to do. I have the type of skills that are so valuable, but I just don't know how to make them get me money. And I'm just using money as this fucking code word for power. I want to be able to say no to people. I want to say no. I'm not going to do this. You have to buy your autonomy, you have to buy the ability to own your time. Time is property and we're born into this situation where my time is already owned by someone else because if I don't give any time to anyone, I don't have access to food because food costs money and money is time. And so making a system where simply to live. I either need to have parents or being a position where I'm supported or I need to be giving my time to a company. And guess what? If you're the most skilled, you work at the best company and who's the best company, the biggest company. And it's just this system where everyone's time. People who want to maximize how little, how much money they can get out of it will go to work for the best people because they can give the most money. And who's left to work with people with not as much budgets? People who aren't trying to just turn their time into money. And it's this self-fulfilling loop to me of the people who care most about money are driven to care to do stuff with money. And they just grow and they grow and they grow. What about the people who make a lot of money and don't want money? I'm that person. I don't want to make a lot of money but I'm skilled enough to do this shit that other people who make money do. And it's making me really fucking mad because in my ideal world, I just code an app for a week, launch it and then turn that into $200 a month. That's all I want. But now you gotta learn TikTok, you gotta run. I gotta do a bunch of jobs. I don't care about. I just want to make the thing. If I spent the amount of effort I do in making YouTube videos on making things and learning math, I'd be a fucking great YouTuber. But the problem is I don't want to spend time on that shit. I want to spend my time building things, learning things, doing cool new things, fundamentally. But that means I should be hired to do such a thing. But now I'm in this issue where I don't want to work for someone else. So I have skills that someone pays for except I don't want to be bought. And so now I have to turn into a producer, someone who makes shit that other people buy. Or I have to be the one that buys other people's time and manages them effectively. And yeah, I mean just piss me off.

 Next on the agenda is to kind of deal with the data storage a little bit better. I've got all of these entries and I'm only saving the dates. I want to know a few questions. How can I search through all of the entries for different keywords? I want to be able to upload or tag them at least in some kind of smart way. Can I do recommendation systems on my own journal entries? Also, for every entry, I want to make a TLDR. So like a one sentence summary maybe with some keywords that get saved in the entry. I want to use OpenABI, OpenA app for that or if there's some offline options, let's look in that too. Just like keyword extraction that should be able to do offline. I also want to make a summary for entries by the day. So like after I finish all my entries for the day, make that into one big journal entry. I want to take the entries. I want to glue them into a journal. I want to have a journal database. And we should do that. I don't know how to do that. These are all ideas that I don't really know how to do the details for.

 I think a document that would be useful to make is my thoughts on using AI to create things. And I want to, this document is something that I want to be an internal reference. I want to design internal references. So each one of these documents should be simple in scope. It should address one thing and reflect my opinions on those things very closely. But it should also be very well written, technically written with good arguments that I would support and I came up with. But it should almost be like the reference version of myself. So I really want to break down what goes into this document. Obviously it's going to be a very descriptive title. And the point of descriptive is to be referenced easily later. There's going to be an abstract. There's going to be sections. And each section will be... So I want to organize it based into maybe chapters, sections, kind of like a book where on top of being referenced, there's also... If you don't understand my points of views, here's a thing. It'll also have links to other references and stuff like that. This is really blowing up in scope because what is the data structure of such an object? I think I'm going to be building it. And then I'm going to have a giant pipeline of stuff connecting to other stuff that's just going to be my own custom pipeline for transforming my own data. But man, it's going to be a pain in the ass to build.

 So I just did a bunch of styling stuff. It looks pretty good actually. It's like more usable. The colors definitely aren't exactly there yet, but I also added keyword extraction and summaries for all the entries which is pretty nice. I don't know how much I'm gonna use that feature, but it's available. The next order of business is I've got all of this text and I don't want to go through it myself. It's really annoying to scroll. I want an intelligent thing where I prompt, you know, give me an idea about blah blah blah and it searches through my database and gives me the most relevant. I know most relevant five entries in my journal. It summaries on them on that prompt. So it's like an intelligent search through my journal where I'm not looking just for what words match here, but what ideas are most relevant to this idea. So kind of like a map between ideas would be pretty cool.

 Alright, so another issue is that every entry is getting saved as an individual JSON folder. So I need to do the database management right now. The issues are I'm going to be changing what kind of data gets stored, mainly expanding because some of them have only been storing the text in the date but I might do like text date and metadata. So I need a way to store and I think it'd be nice to store locally for now but I want to go from just saving a JSON maybe to some, I just want to stick with JSON for now. So instead of saving each individual thing to a JSON it might be easier to make one big JSON. So your prompt now is to... Actually, I don't know, I don't want to do that yet but I'm just going to save this for now.

 Wow, so this is pretty cool. I've used chatGPT to help me make this website. I won't hide it. And what it does is I can click audio recording and you know give it a title. It'll record what I'm saying. Then it'll transcribe it and I can view those entries later. I should save the date and time too. Now what I want to do is begin work on the piece where I'll send that off to the GPT via the Open API, OpenAI API and then use that to turn my recordings into to do lists.

 I'm wondering if for the background I can just show a bunch of art that I find interesting or things that I want to showcase rather than having to put my own background and become an animator under with the copyright. I think there's no copyright on showing images hopefully right like I'll give credit to all the artists. I'll do all of that but I think I want to mainly just have like me talking with a bunch of very interesting images rather than images that reflect my personality. Things that I've curated to be interesting and I think that'll be cool.

 But the thing is that there's, I hate to be the Barrow band means but there's not a single you talk about your thinking. That's exactly why it's good because the thing that I'm, that's exactly why some people get paralyzed because why do people not write new books? But now let me ask you this, not a single. But I'm not saying don't. No, no, but I want to say this. You go to Barnes & No Books. You pick up a random book. How many are those are new thoughts? No, a lot of times you pick up a book and you go, are you serious? Somebody is selling something new. And but the thing I want to say is you might say one original sentence in your whole life, but that would make your life worth it. That one sentence. But you know how you won't get to that one sentence by thinking. You won't get there by thinking and then saying it. It's by what? By just as you go along me suddenly. Think about how I am going to speak so much into this damn thing. Oh man, I'm so excited to now plug into the computer and and and have did summarize what was I talking about and my thoughts, you know, what do you think of this person? Have my entire.

 So what I need you to help me with is your job is to research how can I make money off this. And the way I want you to answer this question is what could I give to you that you would pay for? Okay, I heard you. And you got to help me make my newsletter of my blog. I can make a blog. I want to make my blog. You know how I'm your first blog post. You're about to reach two, man. Yeah, that YouTube video sucked. I can't. No, I'm just a long-concent low quality. Yeah, I was like, what? What? Yeah, I went a low quality long form. No, man. People need to hire quality, you know, man. Yeah, exactly. That's why I hate it. Because it's supposed to be for the everyday person, not for the person with a big budget. Hey, I'm paying a few, Paul. You got to the case and everything. All these three apps. Yeah, I was saying it's ruined. That's not the point of the internet. The point of the internet is for everybody. No, it's supposed to be saturated with business. That's the one that interests to make. You just want to disagree with me. I'm not disagree with you. You're being a free market society, boy. Okay, so help me with this blog post. I think the best first blog post would be how I made this. Yeah, I think so. I agree. You know, sometimes it gets draining having the answer to everything. How can I best support you? Come up with the answers yourself, too. I have answers. What's your question? I told you my question. How do I make this big money? How do I get a thousand a month? A thousand a month. That's different. How can I make this big money? Yeah, I want to get a thousand a month by June. So you want six bands by June? No, I want June to be the first month I make a thousand a month. Okay. How do I do that? So what are you willing to do? With what? I want to show your face. You should have like... I think what you do is fight. You should do that. Or like, okay, send it to me. Just show my shit to everyone. No, everyone. That's why you do a demo. I sign up for a demo with you. But don't they need data underneath their data in order to like do this? It's like, all right. The whole point is the part that I'm doing as genius. I'm going to wrap it up into an app so that I could just give it to them and be like, oh, yeah, I'll just plug in your hard drive or whatever. Okay. Okay, cool. But like, what would be an emergency? That's why they're saving their stuff locally. But they have to. It's a journal, really. Well, it's, you see, it starts as a journal, but it could be a whole much more. It could be like, maybe every time they have a meeting. You want to ask questions about what happened in the meeting. Yeah, because it's not just getting the minutes you're able to, because how many times have you been in a class? And you maybe you recorded lectures and you, and now you're able to ask your good notes. Oh, when the teacher said this, what did they mean? So, yeah, give it to people who have to give it, and if Kate has an exact meeting coming up, or you can give it to someone in the class or student. Yeah, I think what that'd be great is you record your lecture, and then you're able to ask questions more about it, and it reconstructs your lecture from the text. That would be amazing. Hmm? If you just use it and it have a web meeting with somebody, like this, or what I got from this, or people who are not. I can't ask for some money. Okay, well, I know, but like, okay, just a demo. I know they say, okay, but this is how you get to the month. Or you can have during final season, people need to have. Yeah, that's a good final season. That'd be a great time to run the ads. Exactly. Great. Sorry, I haven't already watched it. So, but what would it be like you upload what? If you upload your notes, but then people's notes are also messy. That's why you said type written notes only. Yeah, like your Google member, how during PSM you'd have all those Google docs. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, upload stuff. You know, I could go to PSM and be like, oh, yeah, I can make it so it queries through all of your students' work. I think it's a good time to do that now since you know, since, you know, they're low. Playing on trying to arm me. No. But you get your work, or probably can be remote work and get bands. You know, that's easy. That's quick. That's like you're not even doing it. It's my side, dude. I could probably ask Dr. Westo. And yeah, he's the chair of it also. Yeah, I can ask him because I'm like, yeah, it's what I may like. I think that she declined your position. Yeah. Do you think I would be working on PSM right now, man? Hmm? Am I having any working on PSM right now? Yeah, no. Like no. And then they stop the lesson. They want to meet in the subs to English teacher. Are you crazy? No coach for tattoos saying, are you coaching me, Steve? Okay, but anyway, I'm turning my recording off. I'm not making money. No, no, you made them. You turned. Oh, no, baby, why are you two there? I'm gonna just pause it. No, because my app is not good.

 I think this reveals that the most important thing for me is purpose. And purpose to me is it gives answer to everything else. It's, oh you're not working hard enough, you're not motivated. You don't have purpose. If you have purpose, all else will come. I have to, so what I'm doing now is I'm looking through my stuff in the house to find. You know, if I have any Raspberry Pi's lying around because I at one point elected so many of them because I knew I would need them later. Only to not place them in places that were easily accessible to me later. Although I have easy access to a bunch of ESP. Now I'm talking to myself. ESP32's. I mean the benefit of the Raspberry Pi is that I can easily run the Python stuff on there. And I can't do that on the ESP32. Like a Pi's hero would be nice if anything. But I had a Pi Raspberry Pi 4 somewhere. I have no clue where it went. It would honestly be like probably if I can't find it just off of a first three glance. It would honestly be cheaper to buy another one. But you know, I'm going to have to collect a bunch of bits and bombs I find around the house. And like, you know, things that seem useful flash drive, storage, all that stuff with the hopes of getting it. But really what I want is a place to not like host everything on my computer. I mean, while it's convenient for now, I kind of just want like a local database of sorts, like local home server storage thing. And you know, I thought Raspberry Pi would be perfect for that, but I have no clue where mine is. Rich, at least sucks. But I'm sure I can find it. And if I can't find it, I'm sure I can acquire one somehow. Yeah. But that's what I'm looking for.

 Wow, this is great. I solved the tagging problem without using the chat GPT. So basically what was happening was in the upload file things are being sent as like form data and so the tag was being sent as form data when you clicked upload audio. But on the transcription the info is being sent as a J-Song with the file path and all that so I initially tried to just put the form data solution happened on the transcription but that wasn't make it made it so that when I hit the transcribe button I couldn't it actually wouldn't run the route on the flash side. So I asked what happened and it turned out it was because I was trying to both do form data and JSON data on the transcription button and the way to change and I also think it was because I overloaded names so I put tag, I had to, I had tag the output and tag the label for the output so I basically just did normal debugging stuff and fixed it by myself and I'm proud of that.

 So I learned a little bit about clustering, like how hierarchical clustering and canines works. That was interesting. I also learned about Boltzmann networks. I think it's interesting in general the concept of you want to learn a distribution. And if you learn that distribution, you can then make probable data from that distribution. So if you could turn any inputs into a distribution, you can begin to generate things. I really want to learn some basic questions like how does one learn the distribution of consequences from there being a fire in the in California. Like what what decisions is it that I actually want to predict or generate like I need to understand what the fuck can I do with all these tools. I also want to know how they work. So how does how do these generative model work? What what is a roadmap of small pet projects that I can do to understand them? I like projects that can be done in a few hours like breaking learning something up into something I can do for two hours every day for a week would be great. Especially a project based thing would be pretty great. So I'm thinking about.

 By suddenly it began to have a few thoughts about app development. One of them is thinking sort of what goes into an app because if I want to make these apps kind of every week, every day, I'm going to have to think about that process and one of the things that's really annoying me, one is, well I don't understand really the HTML or CSS, I'm going to make that a to do. And then the other thing I want to know is that it seems like there needs to be some component of data, valuable data, either data that you spent the time to go find or you analyze in a particular way, you can give novel insight to this data. That's really the service that I, a lot of my apps seem to provide is some curation of some special data that you get from good taste or good analysis. And then you know at some point I'll be thinking about a good user experience, but it sees like the key component or just really good data because since I'm not really coding anything, I'm not really adding any new functionality, I'm not making things faster. I'm not inventing any new systems, I'm really just taking existing stuff and throwing it together, which means either you make a novel way to throw old things together or you find a novel way to look at data, but I have yet to have an idea that has to do with actually doing something better. I don't know what to make of that, but it also looks like I don't know a lot of technical knowledge on computer stuff, but I should probably learn that at some point I just don't have a good roadmap because all the roadmap is just making it programming, not actually understanding design and software and stuff.

 Oh my god, this is great. I fixed the tagging issue and it was I learned a lot. There's I chased the bug that I thought existed for a little while. The bug I thought it was was that somehow the HTML didn't know what the tags were and I didn't know where I should compute that. Then I made the solution to basically test how the how does the HTML even know what this is when I run the flash group and I thought somehow it was doing some smart checking of the label the variable names. Whole time the real answer was you have to when you render the template you have to pass the data that you want to be in the HTML and I didn't even know that because I didn't really understand what was happening because I didn't write the code. Now I do understand that and it made me realize the fact that I could debug was the important part but knowing your code is very helpful but the way I debugged was basically by reducing data types into simple simple data types so I could find exactly what is the problem. I wanted to know was it a problem with lists was it a problem with HTML and I think this is where the decoupling came in. Basically I used a lot of software tricks and it helped me make cleaner code at the end because the code that I wrote has to reveal to me exactly where the bug that bug was and so I understand by refact by fixing errors you're able to make your code robust to that particular error which ends up making it cleaner as a result.

You are there and you understand perfectly the mindset of someone who is young, a version of yourself. You know that they are incredibly talented, incredibly skilled, incredibly driven. One of the greatest minds you have seen, but you know that they, much like yourself, struggle to turn their skills into money or networking or the favor of others. These incredible technical skills, the ability to problem-solve, to interact with technology, to build products, the ability to understand people's concerns and be analytical. And you know that you can take this person and make a millionaire in the next year. But you need to tell that person exactly what you need from them to get them to where they want to go, to make them to a million dollars. You tell them exactly what information they need to get from you, whether it's real-time news info about where they live or what's going on in the country or wherever. And you will tell them exactly what steps to do next to make money off of those data. And the steps are really specific and really actionable and really related exactly to what they, I told you, with my data. You don't tell me general advice to save the everyday person. You tell me advice that is exactly tuned to knowing just how amazing I am, my unique identity.

That made me realize, you know, I should maybe take a different approach to music production and make things that I would want to hear and I would play in the background for coding whatever. Yeah, I mean, I think I could definitely do that. I didn't even know that was possible. I thought I'm music is just to get people's attention, not to help people focus. Um, yes, I think I should like approach music sometimes like, what would I do if I wasn't trying to get someone's attention? Like, what if I wanted someone to put me in the background, how would I sound? Um, and I think that's a great, great approach.

 I think one thing to note is I'm using the natural language tool kit to do summaries right now and it's good at grabbing the important sentences but it's not really good at summarizing the ideas. It just sort of condenses the text which I mean there's multiple interpretations of what a summary is. The other thing I'm noticing is the transcription is a little bit off. I mean I can understand it because I just said it but I think if I was far removed I wouldn't know what I was trying to say but I need to do some tests to see if the general ideas are still there. I mean there's some meaning that's lost with punctuation and all that stuff but honestly I'm pretty happy with it right now and I think getting any more improvement would be meaning you know paying a big company's API to do it which I will at some point but for now this does the job pretty well for me and it's totally offline which I'm happy about.

 Something I want to tell you too is as I was thinking about how to make these AI technologies process my ideas well. I was reminded back to when I was telling you the computer is nice because you can tell it exactly what you want it to do. But now with these large language models you say give me an essay about this and it'll give you an essay it'll do exactly what you wanted to do but it's not the essay you want but it still did what you wanted to do. So the art now that I'm learning is a different type of how to get a computer to do what I want. How do you get a large language model to produce the outputs you want? That's really what you're saying because the output I want is tell me what to do next and so the problem that I've discovered is can I use something which is supposed to be a reflection of all of humanity's written words that's accessible to tell me the next thing to do in my life and that might sound stupid or it might be one of the most brilliant things I've ever thought of which is billions of humans have lived before right? Oh are you asleep? Billions of humans have lived before. You're telling me that out of all of the art we've produced all of the news and the politics you can't tell me what to do next if I give you a whole blurb of my thoughts and my skills. If I give you a really accurate representation of who I am and you know everything about humanity you can't tell me how to make money you see what I'm saying there's something silly there to me that if it can't happen now it'll happen in a matter of time and I can find it by understanding how to best turn my thoughts into predictions of what I should do next and it's forcing me to break down how to specify to this machine what I want because when I think of an idea it would give me ideas and be like that's not what I want what I want is and like what when I say actionable next step that's really not well defined what it's forcing me to do is define exactly without argument what I mean by an idea what I mean by a next step what I mean by money what the per it's forcing me to be so incredibly clear about what I want that I think it's actually making me smarter and I wanted to say that let me record that

 Wow, so kind of a cool consequence of this is I'm actually documenting my progress by using this little thing I made, the app journal. Everything's being sent to my computer and it's happening locally, which is kind of interesting, but you know, I want to make a dedicated thing for that. I mean, I'm happy using it on my home network. I imagine if I'm out of the house, I want something that sends it off to my home network or in the cloud as I think, but holy shit, I'm actually using a journal. The second component of this will do all the processing on these entries, but now that I can save entries, I'm pretty much good to go. Pat on the back for me.

 Okay, so the main thing that's kind of odd right now is I need a kind of a naming convention because it's really annoying to type in the name of the note every time. So I mean be great if I could just speak and then you'd automatically name it. But this is now where the really interesting stuff goes. How to display the information in my journal that makes the most sense to me. The other interesting component is I do a lot of mathematics and I'm going to be able to need to maybe even include equations and things like that. So I think there should be a separate upload additional text file, you know, because I mean I think I'm happy uploading text. I mean latex and then you know maybe a little whiteboard area that let me scribble something in to include in my note and then it turns that into latex. That would be cool. So that's what I'm working on now.

 So, there's just so many different things to possibly work on and it's not clear which one will give the most value. I mean, even if I do make the to-do app, for the to-do function, it probably won't even help you that much. Because, I mean, what am I going to be confined to if I can to-do? I want to reorient myself into really understanding what is a journal and why do I keep wanting to have one even though I don't have it. I mean, that's the things understand. And what is my end goal? Is my end goal to just become more productive? Is my end like what is it? I mean, I do want to be able to make more, but I don't want to make useless crap. And I think I have a built-in filter in my brain that doesn't just want to like feature overload because the issue is like the Apple journal app or all of these crap, they got so many features. And I just want to make something that's simple, does what I want. And I'm not going to lie, this does that already. So...

 woke up a little bit ago, doing my daily routine of talking to the channel as soon as I wake up. Now, a lot less clear what I want to do today with the app channel. One thing I think will be very important is to make some kind of knowledge base for the document that summarizes all of my findings so far and something that I can present in my meeting today at 3pm. The overwhelming challenge to that is I have all the data, I have all of my journal entries. In order to make this referenceable, I need to search through them, I need to query them. So, the next best thing would be to learn how to intelligently query my journal, not just off of words that appear, but like use my journal as a knowledge base. I saw a video where a guy used Google Gemini to do this, and I could probably do it in a notebook. And that would be functional, so I'll probably go there and do that. But, I mean it would be nice. So, I mean, okay, I think I want to go from that. Now, the hard part is I have to do the thinking on what I mean, just creating documents so hard because you got to know what you want to talk about. You got to know how to best say it, you got to push through the revision process. And I really hate that. And I get bored by the time I write something and I hate reading. So, I just, I dread making this document, but I think if I think of it as a reference document, it'll be useful. But, man, I just wish something could do it for me. So, I'm probably going to spend a little bit of time thinking how to do that first. I slept pretty decently though. I drank a little bit of alcohol yesterday and I think it's still in me. I don't feel as rested as the previous days. But, yeah, I mean, I got to start processing the documents. I got to start. I've now reached a point where there's stuff to be done in order to share it with other people. And I don't want to do that stuff, but I got to do it anyways. I need a task management system. But the thing is, I've already said everything I need to say. Now this is where I need the AI assistance to make all these documents for me. But, yeah, I mean, the hard part is that documents are not going to be as specific as I want them. But I think I'm just going to do it anyway. We'll see how it goes.

 I don't like things that are not specific. So something like make a wealthiness and meditative blah blah blah app. To me, even though it's a good idea, it feels almost clearly made to grab attention. I don't want ideas that just grab people's attention. I want ideas that solve a problem that I've talked about in my life. I want to solve the problems that are hosting me back first. And once I'm able to become the version of myself that I really like, then maybe I'll make an app to solve other people's problems. Yeah, here. And I've done a pretty much a lot. So, let me pop it up. I would, so I think what it's forcing me to do is identify what really are the things holding me back. And overwhelmingly, it's how fast I can work. When I say I want to be more productive, it doesn't mean that I just want to show people how productive I am. It means I want to be able to build more, build faster in one day because my brain and the rate at which I think and the rate at which I generate new ideas is much faster than my ability to build those ideas. If I could build as quickly as I could think I would already have been on the moon or something. So that's one limitation I have. The other limitation I have is resources. I don't have money and I don't want money in order to live lavishly things like that. But I want money to be able to say, oh, I need to pay someone to do this. Because the way to build more, build quickly is to have the ability to purchase labor from others. And what I'm seeing is that with AI agents, I may be able to build a lot of the workers that I need myself using AI. Like I may be able to build a personal assistant instead of find a personal assistant. And I may be able to build a marketing person who makes Instagram posts instead of hiring a marketing person. And that's why I'm interested in how much can I automate certain parts of the labor process once I've broken down the problem. Because that'll allow me to build more quickly, to prototype quickly. But it would obviously be way nicer to build something that other people recognize that I have the ability to build something upon which I get more resources. But also for personal benefit and interest, I think it would be fun to have a product that gets used. Because to me, the difference between people who say, I want to do this, I want to do that. And someone who's doing it is that they've done it. And with social media and all these different things, you can get your eyes on a product. They're not going to be quality eyes per se, but you can get eyes. You can get users. You can get people to give $2. If I had 10 people give me $2, it'd be great. But I just want to be able to tell someone, yeah, I did that. I know how that, because that's when you get to start being able to make a YouTube. To me, I can't make a YouTube until I feel like I know what I'm talking about. And I'm beginning to feel like I know what I'm talking about. But anyway, I'm saying I need to solve the issue of, I think much faster than I can do. And I need to, people would say you need to think less, do more. But I want to be able to think more, do more. So that's kind of the problem that I'm addressing right now.

 I just had a fun idea that I want to note for later maybe my personal website, but the idea is making a program that takes in a math document and it kind of simulates someone typing it on screen. It's like the typewriter effect, but they're writing late text that compiles and you can see it. As if someone's writing a math document, I got this from the Sheeper vacation of GVO. That math doesn't actually make sense. So the idea would be you have some late text document. It does the typewriter effect. You put random strokes. It's sometimes it's wrong, but eventually it'll be right. Compiles and you can see math being written and it gives kind of a human flavor to things.

 When I think about an ideal conversation partner, my first thought is for what? Because in some sense I think even a therapist is a conversation partner, and it's for a specific task, which is whatever thing you've gone to the therapist to address. Or a doctor is a conversation partner. But I think the thing that is being highlighted here is they know something in particular, or you trust their level of wisdom on a particular topic. But there could also be conversation partners who are not necessarily experts or giving you a service, but are just there to get more out of you. And I think of people like life coaches, like my experience with Peter. He basically said not much, but he only asked me questions that made me think about my own thoughts deeper, which enabled my thoughts to have a little more quality to them, and to be a little bit more personal with me. And I think that's what I'm trying to recreate. But conversation partners with other people, or conversations with other people, I'm almost trying to do something very anti-social, which is can I simulate a really good conversation with a mathematician or a business leader on my projects with large language models? Or do I really need to be with that person? And the thing that I'm considering is that for the highest quality, of course, you will need a human conversation partner. But for things that you're not that knowledgeable about, I think AI will suffice for a lot of things, which to me is very helpful because I don't want to get to expert level on these topics. I want to get to the level at which I'm better than 90% of people. And I think a conversation partner or some kind of personalized learning system is what will do that for me. Because I could continue to try and read books and watch videos, but one thing I'm really noticing is there's not enough storage in my brain to begin to learn new ways of thinking. The only way to update my way of thinking is to see it firsthand, to be on the field in whatever it is. If it's mathematics, I need to be doing mathematics. It does not suffice to hear people talking about how to do mathematics. And likewise for building applications, because a lot of the stuff that I've learned in the past three days, I did not know. But I have since learned a lot that I don't. And if I would have taken the class, sure I might have done tasks of similar complexity, but at the end of the class, I would just have my homework to show for it. And it would be up to me to find ways to use my homework for my own good. But with this, even if I totally abandoned it in two weeks, I'm saving everything. I'm journaling everything. I'm documenting everything. I can put it on a portfolio. I can put on a portfolio that says, if you need someone who's done something like this, I know how to do that. But that's why again, I want to say that I'm creating tools that I will use because then I will never abandon them because to me, what's more essential than a journal, almost nothing. And so by creating my own journal, which is doing exactly what I want to do, I can't imagine ever getting rid of this now. It almost feels like I already knew journaling was going to be and talking especially our huge parts of my life. I've made something where it's almost seamless. There's a lot of issues with, let me hold on, I got to start recording all done and do that. But ideally, my life will just be recording everything. And then it gets uploaded to my thing all the time. But I'm saying that the real beauty is not in that thing, but in what I can do with that information. And... I think I'll still...

 One thing I just realized is keywords, not not be the thing I'm thinking about. I actually want to maybe have topics. So I want to see if there's an offline option to get topics for each of the entries. And a topic is a word or a thing that wasn't necessarily mentioned in the text, but it is a topic that the text is about.

 So I could do the vector search for my journal using some open source libraries. And it would help me compress my data which would be helpful. But I don't want to do that right now because I just want to chill and do something fun, even if it's fun and math, math, or fun little puzzle or something. But yeah, I'm going to do some unstructured work for a bit.

 Okay, I'm having a crazy Jimmy Neutron Brain blast. There's a few things to note. I've got the Chachi Reti reading all my journal entries and giving me actionable steps, they're pretty great. But one noticeable interesting thing is that all of the 99% of the ideas it generates says it'll make no money in the next year. One of them said it would make money and that is monetizing this app. Which honestly seems legit. But I realized I need to be doing two things. One, engineering the prompt is going to be of utmost importance. This structured data thing is so amazing. It allows me to get a data exactly how I want it. This is perfect. The other thing is I need to not feed too much into Chachi Reti. First, I want to feed all of my journal entries and then I want it to filter out only the most important ideas and thoughts for making money. And be generous. Have an open mind. Don't just take traditional wisdom. Choose the ideas that you think are most likely to help me make money based on my personality and my skills. And that should be enough. You want to pick the amount of words that a large language model would be able to give specific actionable advice. But few enough words to avoid overfitting. So first I need to make another prompt that filters down into the great ideas and kind of makes my thoughts cohesive. So help me write that prompt.

 I just talked to Dr. Spike, told him to, that I want to make a Zoom meeting with him, and that's going to be 3pm tomorrow, Saturday, January 11th. It would be nice if you could send them process that information, meaningfully, but I haven't built that feature into you yet. But yeah, you're just noting that. He also said he wants to talk about why I would want to study in Sweden, but we'll talk about that later.

 So I just uploaded to the last app journal to GPT. It's telling me stuff like use SQLite for local storage. That's an option. You know, eventually I'm going to want this to probably be stored here for now. I want to scale up later. I want things to be sort of like modular. So I'll be able to plug in a different database later. It's making some good suggestions about metadata to tag entries like mood, things like that. But I don't know how I need to get some good tags and features to assign mood analysis. I don't know something like that, but better user-in-a-face. Yeah, I can go down the line. While I'm the only one using it, I need to worry about that as much. Offline and LP options, that's a great idea. I want to look into lightweight ones for that. But honestly, GPT is probably going to be the best option. It's not incredibly expensive. And it's just way more quality than the offline options I'm assuming. But I really want to think about this recommendation algorithm type thing, where I have a bunch of entries. And I want to be able to find the most relevant ones. I want to do some kind of like machine learning on my individual journal entries. Just so I can practice machine learning boss looks on to make you like a smart journal to use that terminology. I guess I'm just really stuck on... Okay, let's go back to basics. I told myself by the end of the day, I'm going to have a thing right. The app to my phone, it'll give me a daily to do list. So let's build that. Here's what I want you to help you with. I want to speak into the app journal. I want to have an option where I can tag that as a daily to do. And then that's going to be sent to open AI's API to turn into a to do list. Then I'm going to have to do some processing of the prompt to turn that to do list into like a checklist that I can interact with on the app. But right now, let's just start simply. I want to add a feature on the record audio.html page, which I'll refresh your memory on what that is. That allows me instead of putting in the title, I can just tag it as to do or as miscellaneous. And if it's miscellaneous, it'll just save the entries as the date. And I want the date saved as month day time. And I want that to be the title of the entry in the entries that HTML.

 I think using generative AI could be useful to the one tool I think that immediately comes to mind was the ones who could generate emojis. That was pretty interesting to me. Actually I wonder how they did that. I mean I imagine it's someone who already knew how to generate emojis, but I think the problem with using generative AI images right now is you need one that has some level of consistency. So if it can consistently make something that's on brand, I think the general theme here is that gen AI needs to be personalized in order to provide branding when you're using it for content creation. And until we get personalized AI, AI that can be trained, whoever gets to train their own models first and knows how to train their own models to be personalized is really going to win in this niche that I'm in right now.

 Okay, so just to catch you up, I'm explaining to Melissa how to break down a blog post into a bunch of smaller concepts. I'm doodling in my notebook and saying that if you break it up into smaller concepts, show how they're related, you might be able to simulate a more accurate version rather than understanding as one big abstract thing. Because then the computer has to be good at catching that abstraction. But how could a computer be good at catching abstraction that humans struggle to catch? For example, not everyone is a talented blog writer. So I said a key insight is that you can't automate what you don't understand. And for me, I try to understand everything as much as I can. But I also need to be producing in order to be given value in this world, I guess you got to produce. And I'm trying to think is there something that allows me to produce more? But why do you not have a brain when you talk? Why do I ask you the question? Let me just give you a general. What is a good blog post? Or a new letter? Because I don't read blog posts, I don't read news letters, so how am I supposed to know? Well, it, okay, a blog versus a newsletter. I think, because what would you call considered a new newsletter? Yeah, just anything. I'm just trying to understand what type of stuff that people could read, what gets read. Because I feel like if I write in my current style, the only people that attract people like me. But I want to think how can I make content that speaks to more people in the written medium. And for me, my big thing is, can I make it look cool? You know, I think it starts with. The person is writing. The thing is, my issue is, I was thinking I make it look cool, and I focus on it too much. Because I believe no one wants to hear what I have to say. That's why it matters on who the person is. Why? It's like, oh, what value can this person bring to my life? Okay, for example, say this one friend who I, you know, well, you know, you just have to bring it like a stamp of your audience. Well, that's the thing is, I feel like I get an audience in real life. Exactly. So why wouldn't I get it on written medium? I feel like the audience in real life would then translate into your written medium. And that case for me. Yeah, but I feel like who reads? I don't read. I watch videos. It depends. Like, I'm thinking of this guy Edmantian. Yeah. You know, I don't know him, but I want to know him. Like, people have to want to know you have to want to know what. So you're saying that the people who are my audience may not think like me. No. But they would want to know more about me. Or what you have to say in terms of like, what does our chapter say today? Yeah, more about your thoughts or what you're up to or what valuable lessons can you teach us about AI or whoever? Yeah, that's the thing. I don't want to teach you AI. I feel like in my deal blog, I would just be happy like I do in real life because I feel like when I add people say that I say interesting things. So why not like find a way to represent that in written form? Yeah, you do. So how can I faithfully represent my full, my personality because in written form? Because I don't know what about me makes people listen. If it's the ideas themselves, then I just need to write the ideas. But I also feel like it's the way I speak. Now, weird I look. All these oddities about me, which means if I wanted to capture people attention, I also need to like show myself because I'm odd. But I would prefer not to because I just wanted to be about the ideas. But the thing is, if you want now, you have to have a product. You can't just tell people about ideas. You have to give people a reward for reading your stuff. Of course. That is called a commodified society. So how do we reward the reader? So the cool shit you do. Say all the cool shit I do. Okay, reward them. What about you for me? Say someone's watching me? I think the reward they get out of is a good laugh. Or something. But also, even there's some content where they're relatable. And the reward you get is knowing it's going to be okay, for example. Because I might see people that are like me or quirky in the ways I try to hide. And they seem to be happy. And I'm like, you know what? I might be able to be happy. There you go. I might be able to be happy. Let people know their concerns will go away. Concerns can go away. So I should think about the most concerning things in my life. Or the coolest things in your life. No, I think concerning because I hear people are worried about graduating in four years. I might make a blog post that's like, why graduating in four years? My junior was graduating in four years. And then I also do cool shit. So then people would like learn that, oh, I'm not a fucking idiot. Even if I'm, and you know, I might even get someone to try to help me. Not for me a job. You know, if I express that. So I think I should figure that out. So not graduating in four years. My dad died. Dead, dead. Struggling with feeling bad at math. Being overwhelmed by life and growing up because in money. And on mental health, the possibility of having like bipolar and ADHD. Bad grades. You know, the list goes on. Things that I imagine other people. And you already have the other people I talk to in life feel better about themselves. Like taking time off school. Grad school. Research opportunities. Things like that. But I mean, I feel like to have credibility. You have to have. Convince them. The story is real. Because people won't believe a lie. Because we will watch movies. And if you make it art, you can make up the story. But if it's fake nonfiction, you have to make it happen. So if you don't want it to be real, you do fiction. Instead of nonfiction. Because nonfiction allows you to tell your message without needing to be your message. So how can fiction be used for education? Maybe I can write about mathematics being used in hypothetical situations. That's always interesting to me. Because math makes fiction real. Like Alice in Wonderland. All these things are like imagine a world where blah blah blah. And I feel like I don't know about physics. But when it's about math, I'm like, what I could ask questions like, what would 4d be like? People like that one. Questions like that. Or, you know, what happens when 2 plus 2 is 0? All that stuff. And opinions about mathematics. I could even write about thinking about math and music. And how I struggle to do the letters. And why I think I never was good at an instrument. Personal musings. Okay, so I think I can generate these kinds of ideas and write about them. Now the hard part when I do get a good idea. It's actually sitting down and writing about it. Because out of 100 ideas, there's a race for these ideas to win, right? And each idea has a lifetime. So it's born, which means I think and I get enthusiastic enough about it to keep thinking about it. So I get puts on my brain to do think. So it's on my brain. And then a good idea. I might even work on it. But as I begin the initial period of work, I might decide, oh my god, this is too hard. So I'm assessing how realistic it is initially. But in the beginning, I'm assessing how much reward does it have? Right. Says a balance. Okay, so then I work through and I decide how much work will it be. If I work for my next meeting of a reward, then I'll drop it. So then another guy might hear brain. This might die here. So this is dead here, dead here. Okay, and then I might work and I might work some more. And then now I need to have a feedback loop at some point. And the feedback loop is what ensures that I keep working on it. Because there needs to be feedback, there needs to be work reward, work reward, work reward for a super idea to get this kind of work. And then I don't really know past that. What happens other than you just keep nurturing the idea. But each idea is a lifetime and there's all these different ideas competing in parallel. And my question is how do I do depth first search on ideas instead of breadth first search? And by that, I mean how do I see an idea through? And the downsides, the pros of DFS or if you land on a good idea, then you are done. In our finish? The depth first search. Are done. But the con is you might land on the wrong idea and so waste it a lot of time. And waste the time. So you want to be able to search and estimate. So we have this like tree of decisions. But it's not a tree because you can have multiple huge amounts of branches. And you want to understand what branches are like. It's like the numerical semi-group tree. And especially you can think about quantities that keep track at each branch constant at each branch. Like some things that's invariance to measure different states. Okay, but anyway, you want to just know which branches are going to die quickly more than anything. And I think the way that my setup is is I'll go and I'll assess the... I'll assess. There's an amount of work also. So each time you hop a decision it costs energy. Decisions cost energy. Which means as you go down this decision tree, you assess constantly, do I have the energy to reach where I next need to be? Energy to reach next expected payday. Okay. And if I don't, I hop on to the next idea. And I think what this will do just if I think intuitively is I'll one abandoned decisions that have more energy that need more expected energy. Then I have and two, what's mainly what it's going to do. And two, I'll be attracted... because of that I'll be attracted to places with low expected energy. Which might be a function of the process of doing that, the micro rewards you get, or maybe a function of like an quantization thing. What if every one week you get a reward? Like for school every four years you get a big reward. But you know, what about gambling? You get a reward every half second. So you just keep going down that. But I think I don't see this flaw in this.

 So if you had all of your dots and text you would want to get all of your philosophy insights. So let's say you get all your philosophy, philosophical philosophy dots which are probably great dots. What would you do with them? Let's say you've got another text file that has only your philosophy dots. So you try to make them into something like coherent in a theory or something. I'm not trying to mens my, I'm actually recording on my phone but it can only hear me. So I'm trying to recap what you're saying to the phone. But I was actually thinking about this too because I was like, you know, how hard would it be for me to start a blog where like it takes all of my thoughts. Only the good ones that are useful to other people because I think, you know, hearing other people's thoughts is useful. Is there any way it can capture my thoughts and give the part that's useful to other people out, you know, or maybe I want to write a book one day. I was thinking, hey, if I app for an hour a day collectively, I'll make like 10,000 words because I'm a pro yapper. I'm sure by the end of the year I could write a book of sorts, you know, I don't know what on. But just having all that text, I think my whole idea is there's a lot of work to process those thoughts, those ideas. But what's unique about this data in particular is it's uniquely you, right? And that's why I think the real benefit is having because if you look at your like, I don't know, whatever YouTube has stored for your specific profile in terms of what videos to send you or what Instagram has stored on what, like all of these companies understand us really well, right? They have a total fingerprint for us in our behaviors. And we don't have access to those. And this is me off because I'm thinking, you know how much better I could make my life if all of this data on me was used to like improving me instead of just like freaking trying to get me to use the app more. Like what if all of this info on my watch habits helped me find a math video that I wouldn't click off of or a math book that I'd actually continue to use that would benefit me rather than just how can we sell more stuff? Yeah. Yeah. This is a 10 per cent student source, can I give you a ride to get the data that is Yea. Well, you could probably do so much. I mean, I'm thinking even the fact that you could probably do mood analysis Just by on the apps and I'll be able to track my mood. I'll be able to track, you know Maybe in one of the notes I was like like the perspective I'm taking is I just speak my mind. I'm like I'm hungry So now I'm gonna be able to go back and be like Hopped into my hungry at what time, you know there's stuff that I'll be able to do basically You know every research question every theory you need data to work on Something what about questions about myself? What about questions? Where you know what if I had access what if I had yap journal back in 2019 when you know trying to assess my mental state with all the acid with all that stuff with She will not be named you know I could really go back and try and piece together what the hell was going on in my life or you know Let me say I take mushrooms on there. I get high one day and I'm like able to now understand like myself And I don't feel bad talking about it because you know, it's on my computer. I don't feel like someone's watching me Not that I care that much before but like you know just in the sense of I Want to be able to and I think this gets more valuable or more I use it for the longer periods of times and the different headspace is the different mental states If I use it when I'm tired when I wake up at the end of the day, whatever when I'm with someone else I just want to I think I want to get in the process of Be an extremist of if I can record everything about myself and I want to make an emphasis that Recording should not be extra work for me right like that's why the audio so easy for me Because I just do what I was gonna do anyway, which is yeah and From all of those measurements I'm doing on my own brain How can I improve my life in a way and I feel like I Diverged from the big companies at this point because they've collected all the data They've collected so much data about me and you But now like we're saying they're not trying to improve our lives. They'll say they will to sell more shit but I'm thinking You know even things like can I Understand could this be given to a doctor to help me diagnose how my brain works or some shit, you know I have like a whole bunch of logs and I don't want the doctor to read all of my logs But is there an algorithm where some shit I can make that could be like you know you have these thought patterns You fixate on this you obsessed these are the common things you think about like a psychologist or a therapist You know what am I stressed about I'll be able to know You know even Like writing a petition I can gap about all of the reasons I think I should be in school It's just so easy for me to produce by talking you know and Ideally and even I'm thinking from the business point of view or if not business but creativity really Or even math ideas right like let's say I have a math idea and I describe how I think a sheep is this or even what I don't get about a sheath and I want to Think what's nice about this is I think it'll go as far as my creativity can go in terms of Yeah, it might start as a journal, but then it might turn into You know an entire database of every project I have that's kind of kept tracking a nice way So I'm able to finish more things and communicate more things and write a lot more things Because I think I'm really prolific, but I'm really bad at like Doing that in a way that like schools or jobs or other people that aren't my friends will be able to immediately recognize Plus imagine you go you go

 Okay, now the tagging system actually works, I guess.

 So I'm hitting the Benjamin after a good day's work. I'm thinking, you know, most of the functionalities there, I mean, I might put some like small features in stuff like that. But I think I kind of want to, you know, make the UI a little bit cooler for mobile, but that's going to be a whole fucking chick show, especially because I don't want to break things, which reminds me, I'm going to push the kind of version and get up. Migrated, I just do light three, added some more functions on tagging entries and searching. So I'm going to commit that, push that cool version control, very nice. I'm definitely pushing private information. The other thing I want to figure out is how to be sort of storing all of this on maybe a hard drive or a flash drive or something that database file in a way that kind of is automatic. Like, I want my computer to check, is this certain, you know, storage device plugged in, hopefully there's an way to identify that, plug it in. If it's stored, update the file. I can do that manually in the meantime, it's not a big deal. I just want backup, so my thoughts, because they're so fucking valuable to me. So yeah, let's stay on.

 I just had an interesting idea. I was thinking now that I can generate ideas and possible decisions from my journal. I want a decision-making agent to simulate making those decisions. And I could make Tinder on those ideas for myself, which I basically add a ranking system and get collected on what I think about ideas. And from this, I could simulate myself going through these a bunch of times and figure out what my expected outcomes are. I basically want to simulate my future. That could be a fun idea.

 Yeah, I noticed that, um, recording for too long seems to be a problem, so I need to find a way out there.

 I'm currently showing mom how my journaling works, which is I talk to my phone, say a bunch of yaya yaya, maybe more specific because the devil's in the details, but I basically spent that past two or three hours, whatever, making this. And what it does is I speak to my phone, computer, whatever you go, but pull up on your computer. It listens to what I'm saying. I'll hit stop recording, and I'll upload the recording, it'll go to my computer. It'll turn that audio into text, and then save that text, and that'll be my journal entry. And then you need to go buy some food. You need to also go exercise. Yeah, but I need to, what I'll do, what I'm going to do afterwards is I'll have all of my entries, and I'll be able to do all of my data analysis on it. Yeah, but I haven't built a thing that's able to tell if you could go talking, but we'll do it later. But this is a note that that was mom telling me about buying food.

 The other issue is that if I make a blog or I write a book or I make a video, I now crave that other people will read it, not just other people, but people I don't know, people who have the potential to give me money or reward me. It's almost as if I don't inherently believe in the messages that I'm writing and what they're worth. I am unable to make anything for myself. I am only able to do things with the possibility of reward or of fame, money, whatever it is. I'm totally consumed by it. My passion of mathematics soon became, this is how you can get so much money doing math instead of doing the wonderful problems. I feel so far removed from that. At the time when I didn't believe that one should chase money. But you know, in video games, you rarely get to become, to beat the game is to become all powerful, which ultimately makes the game boring. I remember playing Skyrim, wonderful game with so much story, but you could become so powerful that you could just kill everyone and not listen and then you wouldn't even be able to, I like Skyrim as a combat game. But the story crept up on me and I think just video games demonstrate that at some point you want to chase feeling more just better. You want to get better at things. I feel constantly driven by improving stuff about myself to the best that I can because I want to be able to do whatever I want whenever I don't want to be limited by anything other than my imagination. I feel like money is limiting my imagination right now. But at the same time I have no clue how to acquire the amounts of it to which I can live my life. I want to be able to spend the next few years creating, learning more. I don't want to spend the next few years just sacrificing my time, trying to understand where I am in life and what I should do. That sounds miserable. I want to be creating every single day sustainably. I don't want to burn out but I want to work at a pace which people will not even think is real. I want to work and develop so quickly and so motivatedly that people will ask if I'm human. And I really want to achieve that state of being able to learn, understand, process information so quickly. Build those skills. We build in home for like a month, two months, just get deep deep deep into solving any problem that presents itself with me with infinite energy. And I'm getting too tired a lot now where I get exhausted from much I think. And this reminds me of the benefits of dieting or substances or whatever. As people are trying to always constantly chase a state of consciousness that most benefits them. And this adrenaline junky brain that I have, I think is largely due to social media, the internet constantly being able to be fed. The most exciting thing your brain chemistry could want for someone who grew up with technology being fun. But I wonder is it okay to let go of wanting to do more all the time, wanting to be better? What happens if I just want to be here? It's really incredibly hard to balance, I don't understand it. And I'm feeling exhausted. I should probably drink water.

 So I just updated and migrated the thing to be an SQLite 3. I have no fucking clue at works, but ChatchyBT did it. It's getting saved to that DB file. I mean I'd call that a successful day. I don't know what else to do other than start seeing if the data is easily accessible and maybe saving everything on a hard drive. The tag system is kind of funky, but you know it does the job. I think the hard part is I don't really know how to tag stuff. That's why I'm going to maybe think of a suggested tag system. Who knows? Recommendation algorithms, all that stuff. But I'd call this a successful first day.
