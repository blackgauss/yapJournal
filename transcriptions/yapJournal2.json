I think that's the really important part to me and I can learn details if they're necessary. I feel intelligent enough to, but just being able to interact with something I created is absolutely amazing to me and I don't know if this entry will be saved or if I'll delete it or what. I got to figure out a stored solution like where I'm going to store this all, I was thinking it'd be cool to have like a local Raspberry Pi server that'll act as my journal. I can take it around and do all that, but I should probably get into cloud storage at some point.",
