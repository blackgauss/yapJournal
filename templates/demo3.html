<h1>YAP Journal Development: A Three-Day Summary</h1>

<div class="timeline">

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h2>January 7th, 2025: Inception and Initial Development</h2>
    <p>The project began with a simple goal: to create a tool for recording and analyzing my thoughts.  Early entries reveal the initial excitement and challenges.  "Hello, I finally got it working on my iPhone... Now I'm trying out doing the recording from my iPhone and uploading everything." (2025-01-07 08:24:22)</p>
    <p>The focus was on capturing audio, transcribing it to text, and storing the resulting journal entries.  Data management was immediately identified as a key challenge:  "another issue is that every entry is getting saved as an individual JSON folder... So I need a way to store..." (2025-01-07 11:11:45)</p>
    <p>Key technical aspects explored included OpenSSL for microphone access and the use of ChatGPT for code generation. The power of searchable text was highlighted:  "the wonderful thing about text is you can search it. You can put it into GPT." (2025-01-07 09:13:57)</p>
    <p class="highlight">Early insights centered on the unique value of personalized data and the potential for future analysis: "the real secret sauce... will be able to do a bunch of analysis on all my entries."</p>
  </div>


  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h2>January 8th, 2025: Database Migration and Feature Expansion</h2>
    <p>The day began with a focus on improving data storage.  "Next on the agenda is to kind of deal with the data storage a little bit better... I want to be able to upload or tag them at least in some kind of smart way." (2025-01-07 10:25:12)</p>
    <p>A significant milestone was migrating from individual JSON files to an SQLite3 database, facilitated by ChatGPT suggestions:  "So I just uploaded to the last app journal to GPT. It's telling me stuff like use SQLite for local storage..." (2025-01-07 10:30:15)</p>
    <p>New features included a tagging system and keyword extraction, though challenges arose:  "Alright, so there was an issue with the new tagging system..." (2025-01-07 11:14:46)  and "the tag system is kind of funky, but you know it does the job." (2025-01-07 14:37:47.836008)</p>
    <p>The day concluded with a sense of accomplishment, despite ongoing challenges: "I'd call this a successful first day."</p>
    <p class="highlight">A key insight was the value of building a tool tailored to my specific needs, even if it meant a less polished outcome initially: "this does that already. So..." (2025-01-07 13:22:50)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h2>January 9th, 2025: Bug Fixing, Refinement, and Future Directions</h2>
    <p>The day focused on refining the tagging system and fixing bugs independently. "Wow, this is great. I solved the tagging problem without using the chat GPT." (2025-01-09 07:37:38.066191)</p>
    <p>This involved debugging and a deeper understanding of the codebase: "I learned a lot... the bug told me how the program worked. And also I learned a little bit about why fixing your own bugs makes your code better." (2025-01-09 08:29:36.713045)</p>
    <p>Further features were added, including topic extraction and improved UI/UX.  "So I did a bunch of fucking around, everything's fucked up now." (2025-01-08 06:14:19.604215)  This entry highlights the iterative nature of development.</p>
    <p>The focus shifted towards more sophisticated data analysis and the creation of a more intelligent search functionality: "the next order of business is I've got all of this text and I don't want to go through it myself...what ideas are most relevant to this idea." (2025-01-08 04:39:43.884408)</p>
    <p class="highlight">A crucial realization emerged regarding the importance of clear prompts for effective interaction with LLMs: "the quality of the analysis...depends on how well I can specify my prompt..." (2025-01-10 08:14:24.449454)</p>
